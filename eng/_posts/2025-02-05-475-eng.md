One day away from the city
In the middle of the field 
Unexpectedly 
Someone grumbled.

They cared for each other next to their brethren,
Suddenly the watermelon cracked.
Ripe, dark red, juicy. 
Kherson.

It doesn't matter that the farmer was harvesting hops.
The brothers and sisters were surprised 
And there was no one with a knife.

Watermelon proclaimed Glory to Life!
