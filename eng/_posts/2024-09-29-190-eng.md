Brave?
It's time to give.
Wax, propolis and honey.
And if I had to 
To become a viper, —
And I can be taken 
For your needs.
 
The worker fly flew
Wings erased.
I did not complain
A drop of honey —
Quite a few.
Nectar was collected,
She treated the sting.
 
And the snake was worn out,
Swallowed pollen
And everyone only dreamed
About its end.
Like a bee, poison 
I gave up the medicine.
Lyakala,
Because I learned to be afraid.
Take all of it —
On the strap.
