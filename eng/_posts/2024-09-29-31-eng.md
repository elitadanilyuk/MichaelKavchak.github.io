Everyone takes on a mission
To serve God and the people.
Good or evil,
Hoping for a reward. 

Love or Hate — 
He considers himself righteous. 
Here's an arrow flying from him —
With love, he lets her go.

For good and evil 
Polarity.
Their charges change.
Loved up and angry again — 
And the stars are smiling.
