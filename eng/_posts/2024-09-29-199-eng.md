Why is it more pleasant for God to be killed,
Killer knife?
And the one who ran away to live,
Left for dessert?
 
Children of Cain 
And his brothers
Stir.
How exactly, we do not know.
Wanted or not wanted 
In good and in evil
Also recognizable.
 
Not Guaranteed, 
But with a greater chance 
To the owner's liking â€” 
As suggested in the commandments,
Agree with him
In obedience to the advance.
