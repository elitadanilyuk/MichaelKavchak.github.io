Yesterday's brothers, inseparable friends
Separated by the blast wave —
The war broke them up.
Far away she is,
And the hatred rolled
Not just by county —
In the Americas and Europe, the PLOW passed.

The key to love has never been found
They seemed to be holding hands.
Each individually we strive for greatness, 
We exhibit holiness, and tone in sins.

The sting of death is so tireless,
And life calls to the top of salvation,
Where an agreement will finally be reached,
Peace and happiness are complete.
