Life and death in the stadium
And for the stands, where the spectators.
Bilateral confrontation
In relation to each soul. 

Wherever you are, there is a competition.
Boxers are two — good and evil.
In the Hate-Love ring.
Individually and in the mass — who is who.

Yes, for a bright show
Medals to be given to both,
Because without problems the student will not learn
And he will not receive a diploma.
