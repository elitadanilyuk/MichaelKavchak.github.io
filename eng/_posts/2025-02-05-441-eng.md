(Dedicated to Bohdan Smolyak.
Wisdom of his observations)

Tries to forget, to jump to paradise.
Powder is available — sniff and radiate.
For a while my body is lethargic
Do what you want with him
Because I'm not mine anymore.

And they really are able to take advantage of it,
Satan loves me differently than God:
The soul of the mutilated allows you to turn
In the body is disfigured 
With a horror of anxiety.

For a good temptation you have to pay:
Abandoning my duties, I steal from heaven.
To Serve a Spirit-Controlled Body
As I tried — in the report of the composition.
