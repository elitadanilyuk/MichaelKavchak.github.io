Secret object.
Accidentally found 
On its territory. 
Cams 
Fixed. 
Crossed 
Back turnstile, 
Late, 
Even though you weren't caught.
 
You are caught 
By himself,
You are afraid 
Your own shadow. 
There is no peace â€” 
They will come for you.
If not tomorrow, 
So now. 
 
Conscience washed
And you are looking for a way out
When uninvited
You step on someone else's.
