Break yourself to become real.
There are no peaks, 
In order not to obey,
The depth will be exposed 
To reach the bottom,
And a fate will unfold that was not dreamed of.

That's the moment. If you miss it, you will regret it.
And you will say “weak” about yourself.
You will exist, not live
Because he didn't believe in himself, he did the wrong thing.

Shortage in heroes —society is waiting.
Calculating for you — 
A chance was given.
Not just a need
Accepts you —
You go into a trance.
