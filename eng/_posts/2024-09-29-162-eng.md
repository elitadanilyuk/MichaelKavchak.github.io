At first they went wild 
And then they became dogs.
Black is called white, 
They consider everyone an enemy. 
 
All around are creaking,
They are very surprised:
Why they are not loved 
And not friends with them?
 
More than once they believed
In trouble, they helped.
And the orcs would like
To add 
In them they were recognized.
