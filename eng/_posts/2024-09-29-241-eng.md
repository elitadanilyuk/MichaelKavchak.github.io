Cinema is also reality.
And in books, fate bears.
Each of your specialties — 
Separately lived essence.

Mention — 
Live yesterday,
Imagine, live tomorrow.
And modern?
Shower,
Do you have it, or did you have it?
Will you have and will not lose?

Imagination and memory, past or future,
Stranger or own, there are many lives.
If and in pieces 
To break them —
Separately and together —
LIFE!!!
