Once in a primitive culture, 
Accepted overnight
In a clean bed 
You fall asleep under the blankets —
From home by the owner.

And it is already strange...
... And in the middle of the night
From the free side
The girl is young,
In order not to wake up, 
It suits you.

What is it? 
Modest and unobtrusive,
Even innocent.
And she needs to sleep — 
Comfortable as possible.

@Чи won't be pushed away
The body of a stranger's virgin —
Gently lies side by side, 
So as not to interrupt your sleep 
And rest yourself. 

Entering into trust,
Offers attractive shapes,
To touch them and touch them —
Relax 
Especially sweet.

And your wife 
Remained with relatives.
There was no place for you — 
That's why you're with familiar neighbors.

Wide enough.
Even one more is looking to Wedge in
Between you and the previous guest.
And to the right of you the fourth 
Responsive Host 
He listens to the tenants. 

Interrupted Friends —
And she needs you. 
And conscience and intuition 
They suggest:
Flesh trains 
Yours and theirs
They expect you to survive.
Do not cross the boundaries. 

Then they will consider, 
That you are not a man
I could have used it, but missed it.
However, after realizing over time,
That restraints save the soul.
