Winning drinks, but also relaxes.
You become inattentive and self-confident.
Your enemies know that.
Therefore, they dig under you,
To be desecrated.

For you to fall
And did not rise,
The battle was lost
And he became a slave,
I was trembling and afraid.
 
Hijacking 
And selection 
From excessive rapprochement —
The law of nature.
Victories and awards — 
Those are weak humiliations.
