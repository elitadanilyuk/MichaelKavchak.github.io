Man in a hurry 
Give to the car 
Ne samo trabajo,
But also thinking.
Civilization requests 
Fast and unstoppable
As they can, reduce 
To the purpose of chronology. 

We complain, 
For behind the car 
We don't have time.
Even now 
She hears us
And his own creator
He plans to drown.

We drowned, 
They drown us too.
Has God been cast out?
So without the insults.
