Why should a miner buy coal?
He brings it home in his pockets. 
Does the owner go to someone else's wedding,
When will he invite guests? 

There is a demand for a product â€” it is sold, 
Pays a penny for it, 
Pour into the decanter, because it does not spill, 
Unless, of course, it's a watering can.

Trembit sound blows 
To drive away the silence,
The reader does not write, he reads, 
If I had something to read, I would write.
