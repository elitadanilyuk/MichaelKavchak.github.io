Priest 
Without a sword of iron,
That spiritual sword 
In his mouth.
With signs 
Savaota formidable
The truth is full
In God's words. 

On the battlefield
Will do little. 
He will aim at the target,
The tank will catch up.
In the back 
The army will do with love, 
Anger will give, 
Grace will pour.

To love the country,
They hated evil,
They defended themselves,
They did not give up their own.
