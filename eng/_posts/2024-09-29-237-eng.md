Lucky for the latter,
Who jumped on the foot of the tram. 
To his extreme 
First before sowing.

At the bus stop 
He did not freeze for a long time
Maybe I drove while sitting,
At the exit 
Did without queues
No more “sorry.”

Lucky man, who makes it everywhere,
Bypassing traffic —
Fate helps who,
Who knows the graphics?
