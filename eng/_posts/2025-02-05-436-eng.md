I can't live someone's life
For several daughters, or at least for a son,
And the Father in Heaven and Mother Earth
We live non-stop.

You cry, and he rejoices
In the neighbors grief, fireworks over the city —
Then the planet grieves, breathes, dreams.
For us here and there,
And only here for her.

Sower and Mower, Philanthropist and Thief
Sacrificing or Stealing —
In the care of me, in the excitement of the peoples
Father and Mother live with us.
