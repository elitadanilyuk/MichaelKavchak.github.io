Extended age — 
Selfishness of conquest,
The lived result,
For good karma,
The Fifth Commandment 
Fulfillment,
Awareness
That everything is not in vain.
 
Delayed retirement,
Kneeling with grandchildren
Children born,
Ink and pencil case —
Heard and Seen
With bliss 
And with difficulties,
In fate woven,
There will be a final.
 
Without you
They would have done it,
And since there was demand 
And you were hired —
For corrections in space
Report is taken.
Reward or punishment
Not for a minute.
