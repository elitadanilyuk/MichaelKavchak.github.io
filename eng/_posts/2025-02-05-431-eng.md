Alarms, anxieties —
Dogs are mad 
On chains.
Hope is a stick in a handful,
The last effort is in the legs.

Heaven — prop up with matches,
The earth is hard sand.
Treason — outright harassment,
Across the river is a broken bridge.

Especially in March 
Do not break the proud —
On the other shore
A mound is outlined.
