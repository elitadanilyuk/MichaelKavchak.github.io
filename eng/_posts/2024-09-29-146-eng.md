The anxiety of the day 
Or maybe days,
The nights were riotous,
Takes away sleep
It takes away dreams â€”
My thoughts flared up. 
 
The soul seeks peace 
Spinning in bed 
He looks into the refrigerator 
Does not recognize
How to get rid of insomnia.
 
Requires an answer 
Behavior correction. 
Belongs, comes, sits,
To return to rest.
