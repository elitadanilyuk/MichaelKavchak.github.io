You will see life in the mirror of death
You live longer, you understand the final better.
Images erased come into memory,
What you keep, you will not be able to save.

He gathered to smoke under the sky for a long time,
And still young 
They ask about the will,
Was he born for such happiness?
They seem to exist, but why they don't know. 

In the beginning, there is an end to realize,
At the finish, remember the start.
Report the light of darkness â€”
That's what it's for.
Learn to distinguish the good from the evil
Not to upset, but to please.
