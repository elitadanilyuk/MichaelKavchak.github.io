Emotions sometimes burn out —
Acute needs gradually fade away.
Jumps for happiness are not so high,
The suffering in the mountain is deaf and shallow.

Old age, indifference, time for philosophy,
Generalization and sorting.
Feeling nailed on Golgoff
And just curiosity, waiting for eternity.

She was laughed at, ignored,
They believed in her fanatically.
Never really imagined.
They finally dared to know,
When death came to Zaporozhye.
But they did not describe.
For the living who hoped, 
And they did not hope —
The barrier of secrets was not broken, 
Not strengthened.
