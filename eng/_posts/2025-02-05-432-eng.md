Would Jesus perform miracles,
One levitation is enough —
Would have nailed the skeptics to the cross again
(Mortal or God —
Let Golgoff determine).

Not enough time. Again and again
They kill the Lord.
They seem to come back to them
Suffering once again,
As if on schedule.

Faith Nourishes,
Doubt dies.
Infidelity is a great power
Destroy is in a hurry.
Therefore, invisible wings are called.
