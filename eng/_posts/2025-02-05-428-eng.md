Something happened that I didn't expect
No one could even think of it.
Chickens counted in the fall
The most precious thing he lost, he managed to caress.

The reward for dreams will not wash,
Romance is a serious business.
Hope will lead there
Wherever you go, what you have not wondered about, you will take it.

They hear the end, lower their hands,
The sky becomes a wall
For the desperate, it's time for separation.
This is just the beginning for us and you.
