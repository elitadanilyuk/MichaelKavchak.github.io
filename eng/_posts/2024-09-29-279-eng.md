Jealousy in dreams
And trust in reality â€”
What else is needed 
Proof of love?
Flirting and jokes in words 
The power of love is new
Without batteries added on the go 
Without oaths and virtues of promise.

You just breathe happiness
Considering it natural,
In the morning you write poems,
About the blessings of the Lord.

Fate is not yours to jump through the bushes,
Not the wise success of the thinker
Not the parents of your efforts,
She is from the Patron.
