They say I lie, I speak honestly,
Require a list of compromises.
I remember and recreate in memory
Not what it seemed, but the presence of facts.

Even if you don't trust your intuition 
And body language,
Change positions
Because it hurt someone.

Okay. Logic will work.
The lie will describe
By the method of the historian,
And not only.
