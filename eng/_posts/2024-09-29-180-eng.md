We are not slaves,
And we are Jews.
Don't Sarah
Our mother, —
Agari,
Mothers,
Honor will not be given
Trample.
 
The bad guys,
Christians,
Lost Knees
Abraham
Diverse tribes in the world,
Hindus and savages,
And we Jews are with you.
 
Father of nations,
Good God,
A native of the river,
As promised,
He multiplied the people, —
The Jew 
Each will be called.
