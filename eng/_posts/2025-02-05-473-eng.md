It does not bother the indifferent, it does not touch the alarmed.
He is interested in plastic and unhardened.
It is selfish, 
He is friends with souls, not with the body.

The self-confident will stumble
Too stretched tear 
Relaxed ones will not chime â€”
Try to find the middle ground.
There are no thoughts, then they will not speak
Trouble is to worry without stopping. 

Inspiration is extremely sensitive
And with the fingers of those touches,
Who in the mountain recognizes the happy
And real life will flourish.
