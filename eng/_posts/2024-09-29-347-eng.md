I have come and I will go, and the Word will remain,
Looking for other drivers.
In the archives of heaven will be recorded
About the harvest of his sums and differences.

You think, word.
He said, he didn't do it.
The sparrow flew away, and forgot about it.
With him you, in fact, saved or killed,
By clicking on the button 
Imperceptibly small.

Lightly touching 
The syllable of words,
Jokingly or seriously,
Unconsciously or masterfully 
Roughly interfere 
In the fate of the worlds.
