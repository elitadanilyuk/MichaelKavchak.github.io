The donated horses are covered with teeth,
And their own are perfect, because they are not there. 
Lips do not swell from complaining. 
Everyone is to blame for the fact that there is still war.

The tank is not like that, 
Not such guns,
Not such planes, 
The weak fight.

Let's take the tericon — 
I'm abroad.

Otherwise, we will not drive out the enemy.
Rotten or crooked — 
For the nation to survive,
You have to have your own.
