A tube was forced on the connected darts,
Turned to the left, flooded the contact,
Improved another shower
But again something went wrong.

The society was replenished with another moron,
The morons of the moron from the laboratory released,
The Next Victim Has Been Praised
And instead of building up, they ran out again.

In a group with morons, the moron himself
Walking along the coast â€”
Between healthy showers, limp bodies
With morons in robes, as with relatives, I congratulate.

(Propaganda)
