Fauched Jealousy
Fates are broken. 
Lack of trust destroys relationships.
Yesterday's heroes become worthless
And no need for facts, enough opinion.

Take revenge on the dearest
And you suffer yourself,
Feelings and emotions are stirred up in yourself.
Yesterday there was love, and now war.
Instead, embrace the grumble and storm.

Do not kiss or caress.
Did not deserve 
It would be better for someone else to take care of you.
As if you love him so much.
But in fact, you are rowing for yourself.
