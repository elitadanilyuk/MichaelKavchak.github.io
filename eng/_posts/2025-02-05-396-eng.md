A special status is the wife.
My neighbor has mine, and I have mine. 
They also say: half,
With her we are a family together. 
 
Between us is not just friendship, but a home forge of patience,
Loving Mutual Service
Strengthen family roots.

The miracle of nature,
Two particles are whole.
Their union continues the RODs,
To carry the living into eternity.
