On my knees I will surely survive,
I can walk on my feet. 
If they are not expelled, 
They'll bury me when I die. 

Worm crawl on the ground, 
Fly an eagle in the sky.
Slide on the water by boat, 
Turtles merge with the bottom.

Honest does not drown in the streams, 
The fair in the fire does not burn.
Abel goes home,
Cain will pay for everything.
