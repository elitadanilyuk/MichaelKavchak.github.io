What is the first
Chicken or egg?
The question is rhetorical. 
Sarmat, or Pershing?
That or that? —
It is customary to lie to orcs.

Of course, “theirs is better.
It is more advanced.”
“For the enemy is harder,
Because theirs hits harder.”

“They did not attack.
And the truth is theirs.”
“They were just protecting.”
A stranger who is already his own.
