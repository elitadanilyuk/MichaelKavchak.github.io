The soul showed itself.
In the picture, in prose, in verse. 
She used her colors,
Where is the euphoria, where the horror. 

Someone captured, 
Annoyed someone,
Did she remain indifferent, 
But she stated: 

I am. I'm alive. 
Count me in. 
I will put myself before you.
I will walk on land,
Swim with water
Do I sparkle for the summer.
