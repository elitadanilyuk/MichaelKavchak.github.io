Why Father
Far from children? 
Why Mother 
In tears for them?
Caring a lot â€” 
Casing in the heat 
To undress to panties
In the icy cold.

My dad understands that,
It gives children freedom.
Mother warms with care
Because it is dear to her.

He lets in, but keeps,
And the child grows.
Living teaches
And this and that.
