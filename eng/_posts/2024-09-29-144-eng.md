Found Twice
In the native he asks, 
Attracts attention. 
Will serve 
And it will not wear out soon, 
Nourishes and quenches thirst. 
 
I would not ignore
Would not miss,
Would honor,
Would attract.
 
Not so many relatives, 
Applicants for the nearest.
We will accept what has been found again â€”
Let there be more.
