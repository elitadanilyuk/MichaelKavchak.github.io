According to egocentrism, I am God.
The world belongs to me, and I twist it.
A generator of happiness, hopes and anxieties
I free myself and torment myself.

I do not hear the war, but the silence rings
I see at night and stumble during the day
That's how my ego chooses. Commanding.
No one around me, I just trust myself.

Between the centers of the universes, yours and mine
Harmony is lacking.
So we ask God, the Lords of the Worlds â€”
May tell. 
And individual gods
Dokupa coalesces.
