Intimate fertilization
And intimate departure. 
Without haste 
And without delay â€”
Do not deceive nature.

You seem to be planning,
You choose the moment,
You think you control,
And you fall into the loop.

Fate experienced
At the service of IDEAS.
Get caught 
Intended
But you can't run away from her.
