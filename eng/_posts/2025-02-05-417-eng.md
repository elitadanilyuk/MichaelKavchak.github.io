Under the blanket of night worlds
I suddenly realized 
What a happy storm.
And not because it's Halloween,
For the thoughts are not gloomy at all, 
And it draws God to bow. 

The soul is so torn to meet the wind — 
And here he made noise.
Dazzling at the top —
He heard me and answered.

Spin, whirl, fast, hurried.
You are strong, I know you are like that.
Not the present, you are eternal 
Not young and not old.
Lift me up, I'm waiting.
But don't break anything.
I make a lot of mistakes myself.
Strengthen better help.

418—8

Encountering another problem,
You are offended by fate.
Having stumbled upon the solution of the scheme,
You are proud of yourself.

Enemies and enemies
Stimuli sono sembra
You try to bypass them.
Without their consent to accomplices
Impossible to grow.

The last challenge is death.
So I want to live!
It turns out, until he dies,
Learn to be friends with death.
