You don't have an army.
The invaders will come.
Military 
It is necessary to feed. 
Workers and farmers— 
The real traitors
When she rarely
Worthy to give.

A powerful army —
The temptation of aggression.
Imperial ambitions,
The regime dictates.
Who is your power?
Who are you after all?
With whom are your coalitions?
You only have to choose.

You want peace 
You will not kill
And my own soul
Above all, you will save everything.
And a sharp ax
You can get it out of the pantry
For those you love
You will lay down life.
