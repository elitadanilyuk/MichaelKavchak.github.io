We sympathize with your grief
From explosions of “brotherly” missiles.
From the air, from land and from the sea
Russia sends you “privet”.

Her love is immeasurable
Ready to suffocate.
False and hypocritical
Rapes. He seeks to kill. 

Destroys cities and villages
What lives destroys everything
And mourns miserably —
Why don't they love her?
