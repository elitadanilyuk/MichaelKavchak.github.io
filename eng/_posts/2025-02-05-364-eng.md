Panic. Disturbance. 
In an even place.
It's not just about two,
And not just in their village or town.

Inter-State Calls 
Change flights,
Someone is happy, someone is crying,
Because the walls have grown.

Do not panic.
Do not fall into anguish.
And calmly say:
Break or build
In order to do better,
Always tension.
