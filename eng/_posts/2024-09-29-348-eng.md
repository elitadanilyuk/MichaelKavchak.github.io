The level of the game called life,
Again, the one who comes to life in solitude passes.
With the unknown alone.
Such is the condition of nature.

From the cell, 
From grain,
From the egg, 
From a water bag,
And now from the human body
The game invites you to a new level.

Sympathize all around,
Pity and cry, 
Although faith is available to everyone,
What will you see in the new world?
Not at the level of suffering, but at the comfort of God.
