And I'm about God
I would like to talk. 
As if he had known Him,
But to declare, 
As for the level of VSOGO â€”
I wouldn't say.
 
The uterus has not yet opened
For the kindred souls.
The heel is pierced,
Require poetry.
 
And lack of growth
Press on the walls
To go out into space
From Earth-woman.
To finally say:
Permitted by Mother
And to know the Father.
