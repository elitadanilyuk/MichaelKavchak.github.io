There is no Plan B. 
More precisely, it will arise by itself, 
When it's time. 
 
There will always be reserves 
When you notice them,
Don't waste right away 
Let them grow.
 
Don't worry 
Sleep peacefully. 
This and Where until I wait.
To get to the goal,
Attempt
Available from NESTi.
And the plans? they
They will find you themselves.
