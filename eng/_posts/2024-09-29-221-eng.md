Not for romance,
Although romantics 
They ask,
Give me at least the wrappers
Bo confetti 
Do not bring. 

And even better compassion 
Boday Crumb 
Humanity.
Now we are not just 
Garbage, 
A bio waste 
Alienation.

Fueled by hate 
And other people's and their own.
We are lost to the universe 
Still alive for a minute.
