We are not loved because we are a fool,
Perverts and executioners.
We are obviously afraid, 
Such are the fathers and grandfathers.

Imitated around the planet
And over the years and centuries 
On TV, in the newspaper:
“May the dream repeat!”

They repeat, oddly enough.
Evil sits in chromosomes. 
They are not ashamed, not in time —
“May the dream repeat!”
