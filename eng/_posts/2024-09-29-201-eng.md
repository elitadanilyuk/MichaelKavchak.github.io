Harmony is embedded in YOU
Easy to change to another,
From best to worse.
In the wild instinct 
StadNyi â€”
Through the hole with a mop 
In the back passage 
(Sorry for the harshness).

Good idea 
And noble,
Compassionate and peaceful 
Satan and Demons
Transform primitively
To aggressive.

Honor and humanity 
With autocracy 
Incompatible.
Restraint
And prudence
They hate her...
... new suffering
And new generations
Unfortunately, Irpin awaits.
