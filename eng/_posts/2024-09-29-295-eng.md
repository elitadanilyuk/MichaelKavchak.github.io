At the bottom of the ocean
Life is boiling —
In the limit where the planet breathes.
Her Beloved
Space in its nets 
Carries into a secure future.

There is an idea in every idea 
Galaxies also have their own purpose. 
So the orchids look
Far away, is it time.

In the time and space of the palm 
We were with you — 
At the end of waiting 
And in nostalgia for the past.
