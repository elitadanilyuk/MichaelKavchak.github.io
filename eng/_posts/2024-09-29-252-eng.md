Our grandmother â€”
Good Landlord 
Everything he has, he gives to everyone.
And very 
He rejoices in it,
Afflicts the family,
Specifically mine.

Relatives to her
They are offended,
Because he lets in the world 
We are poor.
But she does not repent
And repent 
Not going to
He says he's trying 
To make us worthy.

Do not count 
For the heritage,
And on their own strength,
So that they do not become
Lazy
And people were not asked.
