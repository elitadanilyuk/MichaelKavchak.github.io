Lace of stars
Blind in cities.
As if in the cities
We are hidden from God.
The grandeur of the sky,
Fear of the Universe
Fleeing, ashamed, 
Ignored.

In front of the neighbor 
In heroism,
In the competition of ambition 
Guests will disperse
No names and no face.

So it will be recorded:
With all the inspiration
In memory they will remain
A muzzle in your pocket.
