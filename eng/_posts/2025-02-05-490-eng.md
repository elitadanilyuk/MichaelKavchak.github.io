New horizons at the end of the tunnel
For ideas, thoughts, words and deeds.
In discomfort through the hole of a tight fit
You jump into a space you didn't know.

In front of the forehead, the wall is in danger of collapse,
They are already carried to the cemetery, removed from the ground —
Flying through the tunnel in an immeasurable swing
The invisible capsule of the immortality of the soul.

This journey is exciting and full of doubts,
The fear of death scares without measure.
It is not surprising — the fullness is indescribable,
Happiness and ecstasy in the presence of faith.
