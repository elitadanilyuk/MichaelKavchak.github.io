Grateful dreams are already coming true
He opened the gate hospitably for them.
A gluttonous pursuit of happiness —
And it runs away, even though it seemed caught.

Trusted - not something that caught on.
In a good fate, a sensitive soul.
She always wanted to do something good —
No whip, no lure of money.

The cage, even if it is spacious,
Someday empties
For the prey will escape.
Filled to the edges of the pantry
Grateful. And it will fill up more.
