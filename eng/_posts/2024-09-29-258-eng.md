Come on 
On the circumstances,
Do not allow
Crush yourself.
Improve
Incorrect, 
Change the old to the new.

In the efforts of zealous
Achieving novelty,
Laws of the Ancients 
Without leaving.

Don't get off track
And do not ruin the track 
Help categories 
Cyclicity of time.
That is, you find something new,
Just passing once more 
Old.
