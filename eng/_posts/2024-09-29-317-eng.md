A field dotted with bones
Foreigners' douches.
They wouldn't know war without them.
And for them, we are
Not criminals on their land. 

The soil will be even blacker
Golden wheat,
Through the port point
Humanitarian is transferable.

Because that bread would get stuck in your throat
The defender and even the aggressor.
A year or a few years
Bow to the investor.
