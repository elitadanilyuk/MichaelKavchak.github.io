Cluttered world
After Big Bang
From the star*
Hurry to the stars ***,
Moving away from them.
Maybe from chaos
Save the line?
From two hundred 200
To the hundredth of 100,
Without breaking up,
And preserving.

From dogs @@to snail @,
To the foundations from the top,
From the Babylonian
Chief
To the evaluation of the wife.
##-#

From primitive
Clarity
That everything is in the fog,
To Rebus 
Timeliness and thoughts. 
In the competition...
