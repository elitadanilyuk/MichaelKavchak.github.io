Believe in good, remembering evil.
You have difficulty deciding while learning, 
I came to school for a diploma. 
They brought you into the garden without asking,
Attracting
To educational foundations. 

Giving to the world 
With his problems, 
First for the game, fight the shadow.
And on the way out with aggression, death and laziness —
Light with dark forces.

Hiding the light — 
Means to extinguish. 
Inaction to support evil.
So in the face of challenges, become modern,
That the good will undoubtedly win.
