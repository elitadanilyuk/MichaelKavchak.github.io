Golden buttons
Excelbents
On a chepurun uniform
Hiding from the public
Imaginative talents

It's a genius, 
Not the wisest,
The fairest 
And the kindest.

And to him, as well as to everyone, 
Periodically 
I want to eat
It will look stupid
Saut√©
Or get wet.
And someone above him, 
As above the yolop 
Rejoice.
