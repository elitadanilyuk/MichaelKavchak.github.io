“Where is my country?”
Girls in wreaths 
Sing.
The song will end,
Empty stage, 
Wreaths take off.
Merge with the crowd, 
Ukrainian word 
And they will not remember. 

And not Ukraine, 
If the language of the invader
Admissive and insightful,
And the tongue sticks.
Not in Ukrainian 
No advisor, 
Imposed the Russian, 
And the people are used to it.

MARILLY by independence, 
They died for her.
And languages of neglect
She was lost.
