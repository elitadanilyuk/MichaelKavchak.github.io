Trust, 
And check —
There are a lot of speculators around.
Take care of the quality of projects,
So that nothing steals them.

Dedication to the cause — 
The key to success
Supervision and reporting 
Victory is borne.
You will deprive competitors of a sly smile,
Defending the will, and revenge is not the point.

The cards have light, and on the field it is,
Night vision goggles will help.
To stop and contain war and evil —
In good and light this is the purpose.
