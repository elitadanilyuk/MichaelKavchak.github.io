The saints delimit the borders
Mark with their bodies.
Barrier rear enclosures
Consecrated by fugitives.

The first saints are patriots.
Behind them are saints for salaries.
Then holy idiots.
And then we need to search.

Bezkhatkiv, vagabond, drug addicts â€”
What happened to sanctify the border
From the nobles, the Muscovites or the Ottomans,
For the sinful elites to survive.
