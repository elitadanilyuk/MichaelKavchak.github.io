Stuffed with clay or cotton 
I will try even with zealous 
Imagination will not explode
You do not cut the log with the help of a log,
For no reason, nothing will arise
After severe fatigue, you have a good rest.

Reaction to a stimulus
Consistent behavior —
What a participant,
Such is the assessment.

Sometimes to achieve great,
It would seem devoid of meaning —
It is useful to know:
If correct,
Enough and quiet
Words to say.
