Happened.
Everyone has their own craft,
The weekend was waiting for someone,
Others were sent to the rallies.

And someone is supposed to shoot,
To the guards to show themselves,
The candidate for leader is paralyzed,
And someone was killed.

Do you think Trump was hurt?
They destroyed America.
Where will we be with you?
Still ahead.
