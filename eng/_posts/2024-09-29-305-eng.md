Bow and arrow —
Target at the same time.
You hurt someone —
You will be hurt.
You frighten your enemies so that they may be afraid
Know: Fearful and you will not pass.

Boomerang image wait for arrival
If not in the forehead, then in the back of the head.
You see mostly bastardism in people —
So do not wait for mercy from fate.

The problem is that my science
Only the others are concerned.
Give me an arrow and a bow,
Let the near-target be prepared for arrival.
