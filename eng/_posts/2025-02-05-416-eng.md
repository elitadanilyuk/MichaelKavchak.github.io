Vibrations, repetitions, waves, 
Stroke, caress, tenderize.
But sometimes tsunamis are violent,
Everything will be destroyed, overthrown, cut.

Not only on the seashore,
In economics, in politics, in destinies —
Built-in wash off, drain,
Tears are shed and grief.

Rhythms relax
They get used to 
It would seem that's enough.
They have a different plan for humanity —
Disaster mobilizes and experience brings.
