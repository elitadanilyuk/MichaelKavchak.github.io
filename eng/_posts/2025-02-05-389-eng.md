Let's be friends.
Do you see? I have a knife.
Establish control in the area.
Let's rob the little one
So that our acquaintances would be afraid first.

The most humble will be accepted into the gang
They will resist — terror:
I'll take everything away, let them eat the balance,
The eagle and tricolor will glorify us.

History will pass majestically —
Wait for new atlantids.
And if you speak, I will find you a trial.
Nits are enough for people like you.
