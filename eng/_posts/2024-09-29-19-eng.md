Army, language, faith
(Gravilisation, Putin, language). 
Even though the skin is still there, 
To be a human being is a recluse. 

Only in the village is a Ukrainian, 
And in the city — I am a Russian man.
From the capital, Donetsk or from Vinnytsia
The Russian language is spoken.

There is a cool Peter's dream,
And I'm among them like a bull.
We crave slavery and blood —
That's what a racist tongue does.
