Toy,
You can't outsmart the player.
Dzygo, 
You will not always spin
Sirnichko, 
You may not burn
And when you burn, 
You will not shine forever.

Doll 
You can save 
Stitch and glue. 
They will help 
Achieve the goal
However, it is not worth
So much 
Lurk yourself.

The master will want 
Still unfinished 
Can count. 
And how not braveWe,
Becoming Gods
Do not even think.
