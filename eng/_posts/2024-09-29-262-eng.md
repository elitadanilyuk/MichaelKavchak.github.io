You will see the rainbow
With the sun behind your back
Your beauties,
When the light and the truth
Behind.
Facing the Darkness
Come to battle,
You will go against the truth — 
You will pay for treason. 

You will be condemned for evil 
You will cry over yourself
You will lose your friends 
You will lose relatives. 

Reliable rear — 
Good and light.
Therefore, to the lights 
It happened in a friendly way.
