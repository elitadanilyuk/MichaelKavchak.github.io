Freedom to put on sticks,
Take care of the welfare of the empire, 
Paste your people,
Drive away alien wolves —
Not enough intercontinental artillery.
God's fear must be had.

The most powerful ruler,
People and God are the enemy.
Pointless master,
His gains are gunpowder.

Conquers half the world 
It will turn into ruin,
All curses will be upon themselves,
History will undoubtedly go down —
About your own shame
And the cruelty of their country 
Blood in centuries will be recorded.
