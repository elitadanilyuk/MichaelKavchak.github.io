Healing robe,
Impregnated with blessings
(Because someone recognized 
The Secret of Prayer)
Covering the patient
Immortal relics
Opportunity provided
And continue to live.

Full of tips,
Science teaches
Does not recognize mysteries â€”
Only the medicine is mixed.

Plotske
He fights with the spiritual.
Mortal is for life.
And here from death heals 
Not that, 
What do you see, and that 
What is no longer
(Prayer of the giver).
