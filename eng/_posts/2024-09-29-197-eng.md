Everyone has their own experience 
And every 
Wise in his own way. 
Depending on hobbies 
And from the events,
You became a judge 
Or maybe the defendant.

From what I understand 
I can advise:
From the trained 
I take advice.
Only together 
We will be able to get along
Where to grow
Where to remove the bark.
 
I hope, 
I need you
Just as you need me.
As long as we live (as if)
As long as you and I are earthly.
