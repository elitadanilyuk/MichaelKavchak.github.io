Kaz-in-o is a division within and around.
It tears you up, makes someone feverish. 
Voluntary violent school
The most expensive is placed on avocados.

And suddenly you are yourself,
Taking a risk, you win.
They turn on you, because fate has a plan
Prey yourself
Exclude competitors
You will become a master because another gentleman has become poor.

Everything is like in life â€”
Under the bridge, 
Or you drink champagne. 
Entertaining steps of yours
Or in a casino 
Happiness is gypsy.
