Now that is eternity.
And this moment is a fragment of it.
About Being, His majesty,
Announces every moment.

The past will not be lost 
And the future will not be missed
The so-called modernity.
Even if you are scaly.

Asserts on the fly
Their Missions
Painted on the sand 
Is it written on the water.
