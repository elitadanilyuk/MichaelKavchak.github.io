I rejoice in the opinion of another, 
My knife. 
But sincere and honest.
Without fornication and cunning,
Expressive and cushy, 
Without complex structures,
Without drinking and confessing,
Imposition and coercion,
To be in a wonderful shape,
Earthly and heavenly
The truth has grown â€”
It could strengthen.
 
So that they both agree,
They got drunk by communication, 
And they both opened
The essence of the word.
 
For this it is necessary 
Only to love 
The neighbor and the truth.
Climb up,
To reach the sky, 
To let go of sin. 
To live more fully...
... to teach the soul...
So let's keep talking.
