Probably a collection of my speeches
It will not seem too simple.
Under any conditions
I will consider myself weak.

Only with you I work from the heart,
I write rhymes — I can't sleep until I get to sleep.
It's late at night, the light is burning
I wish you a solemn peace of mind.

Yes, no! I will not stop at all —
I would like to extend this happiness for a moment.
Finally I will say: “You are sick like this,
That any kind of suffering.”

“For me, you are the only one.
Mine changed my outlook on the world.” 
My reliable half 
It lifts me into flight.

I am on my way to the cherished goal,
Which has not happened to me yet.
I will overcome obstacles, tear all the chains,
So that no one else can get it.

Forgive me and do not judge harshly
For zeal, confident walking.
The path is chosen by carbide step by step.
Don't worry, I won't let you go.

You are not a hostage, not a prisoner.
If I imprison you,
I agree to release you for the rest,
Who will tear you away from your heart?

I will be glad of your decision,
For your happiness I will do everything,
Translate words into action
My patience will take everything.
