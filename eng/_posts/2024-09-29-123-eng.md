I did not understand. Again. 
God called 
To absurd things. 
How to believe His Word,
So as not to eat shame 
Among the people?
 
I don't want to go again
The wife turned away, 
To be in church again
We analyzed the brothers,
Reversed 
In long conversations,
Converted to the truth 
Long known,
How to live,
Where to go.
 
I did not understand. 
We will have to again
Walk around the mountain for a long time.
If you do not trust 
God's Word â€” 
You will be late yourself, 
And with you, they too.
