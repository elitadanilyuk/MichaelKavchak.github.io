Actively lived, collected inheritances —
No one to take to the trash.
Capped, mocked the elders,
Take with you to the grave
Like them, I couldn't —
Prevented by a high death threshold.

Why does the instinct to withdraw calls?
The surface sprinkled with earth is indifferent.
Then the Sun writes in the dark patterns,
According to the female beginnings, the beginnings of a man.

There is a life
Frozen partially melts.
Taking off on the clouds of znsv to merge —
The illuminated form of changes is famous.
