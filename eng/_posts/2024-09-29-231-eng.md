Is it a diary?
“I won't wait for Monday.”
“I looked at her for a long time”?
In the Vanity of Everyday 
I tear up:
Reciprocity
Was he wrong?

“It was sad now.”
“Laughed out loud.”
In her thoughts, only she 
There is no other 
Missed.

This is not a diary at all —
Of the shortcomings, they are worthless.
Nothing interesting.
Love fuel.
