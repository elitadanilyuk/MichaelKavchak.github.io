The car was stolen 
In the church, in the holy place,
In a strange city.
They went away and no one else 
Take home.
Not even a phone.

We'll have to search,
How to get out of trouble
Ask strangers for asylum.
Trailers alert â€”
So I sleep under a bridge or in an alley.

I'm lost
They were picked up and driven away.
My last concern is
I hope they don't steal my soul either.
