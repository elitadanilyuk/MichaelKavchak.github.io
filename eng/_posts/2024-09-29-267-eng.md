A clean sheet is ready for anything. 
I waited a long time and as it should be,
Still waiting.
Can the artist 
The stroke is applied,
Writer
Folds up the lines,
Gather in an essay,
Does the child chop on the collage.

Until you need it, 
As long as inspiration lingers, 
The letter knows how to wait
And often in stacks,
To absorb into the shower
Scratched 
Words of the voiceless.

To get the paints drunk 
And the eyes delight,
Tear or twist,
Or allow 
Hang yourself.
