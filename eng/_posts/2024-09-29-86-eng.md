God no longer accepts burnt offerings.
Did he become a vegetarian?
Have people got rid of delusions
And the sacrificial ritual fell away? 

They became gods themselves, 
Sacrifices are made to themselves,
Satan rubs his hands
For Adam, the frontier is already close.

As God does not exist, sacrifices are not needed, 
Steal, rape and lie.
You will always have to die,
The victim falls asleep.
