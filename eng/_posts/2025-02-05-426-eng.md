In love and hate its amplitude,
Respect and goodwill work in their own way.
For some reason, the last passclown does not annoy -
I accept with excitement the meanness arranged by him.

Someone loves tenderly 
Cares as much as he can
And jealousy eats away —
Does not look like an image?
I treat the bad
I drive away my family,
I do not forgive my beloved
I embrace the unworthy.

In relationships, labyrinths are twisted.
So that the image does not exist at all,
Remember, be merry, and know, upset: 
“Love the good, hate the evil.”
