The philosophy is a bit fascist,
Cruel and ear-cutting.
Maybe rude, stupid and manly,
Probably, someone's spirit will be outraged.

You can't hide your eyes from the truth
She will go behind the eyelids.
ONE WAY OR ANOTHER YOU DIE
And the soul will be where? 

Conscience will call into the trenches
Will roll over the ocean.
I suggest: make an inquiry for yourself,
Have you chosen the truth, or can it be deceived?
