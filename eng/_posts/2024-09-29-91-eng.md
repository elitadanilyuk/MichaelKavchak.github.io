Easy Comrade
Turn into an enemy. 
And try the other way around,
You quarrel with someone,
To wait, however expensive,
From the enemy of peace hands.

Do not go with him to a crime,
And do not drag on your own.
Strengthen in the truth
To you and him.
Look into the eyes,
Insults to forget,
And in common inspiration,
Leave the prison.

A prison that hates
Covered with mold
And the beginning of the fury
Tightened the walls. 
And in the glow of joy 
At dawn, fire
Heading loose 
To the friendship of the country.
