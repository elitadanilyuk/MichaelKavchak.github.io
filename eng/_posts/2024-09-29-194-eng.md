How not to avoid, how not to try 
Forget about the war, 
Under the sirens 
Fall asleep again 
Or run to the basement —
Take a serving 
“Brotherhood” poison. 
 
This dream would end,
I would wake up in the palace,
And again the drone buzzes —
We wake up in luck.
 
You fight and they beat you.
War has its own laws:
Strong in truth,
Although the body is weak,
No one will break it.
