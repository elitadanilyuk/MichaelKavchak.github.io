IMAGES. Shower rodents.
Not so much strangers as their owners.
“Then let them repent, but do not move me!”
And who is the unhappiest among the quarreling participants?

I. 
There are claims from me.
I am dissatisfied.
Justice sleeps, I am ignored.
With such a burden, will I reach retirement?
One hope: in heaven everyone writes, knows and hears.

They hear and know. 
And they are waiting
When I learn to forgive. 
Tolerant to harvest.
For he on the mountain who forgave us,
Only the forgiving plans to be saved.
