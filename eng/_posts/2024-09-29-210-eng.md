Word of the Day
Searched for the outside, 
And was born 
Inside. 
Feelings indescribable
Explained in a word,
Better than yesterday
We understand now.

You will understand more deeply â€”
You will save tomorrow
You will see wider
And you will go faster.
Obstacles are broken.

You refer to this world 
To continue the evolution, 
Show, 
What are you trying
Do not destroy
And God multiply.
