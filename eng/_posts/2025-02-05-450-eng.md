Familiar song
Good Russians: 
The government is bad, not us.
We were commanded,
Money provided —
Therefore, we kill
And we die ourselves. 
I attacked you,
And we 
I don't want war.

From our knees we will rise again, the power will change,
Let's heal in a new way — make peace.
We will be respected,
They will speak Russian,
Russia will expand,
Let's hug again.

You will see how good we are.
On your ruins, in your rear.
And now 
We are not to blame, 
And money.
Don't judge us, ask Moscow.
