Russian measure in all its glory:
“We can see 
You are crying.”
However, not everyone notices.

So their problem, they say
God loves us because we are cool.
Who is guilty, they will be bound,
We have nothing to do with it, we are saints.

Holy blind, holy murderers.
For grief is in others, not in them.
Indifferent is also a bloodsucker. 
The justice of the wicked awaits.
