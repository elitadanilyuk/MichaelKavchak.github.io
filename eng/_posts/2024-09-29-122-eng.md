He fell, broke his spine, 
He died of cancer,
The one in the area was killed by a castet, 
She didn't wake up in the morning... 
 
This is how we evaluate others,
It was as if they lived to die. 
From the bad to the worst, 
We attribute everything to death...
 
... Raised five children,
He wrote four books,
Protected seven people,
Like no one else, I did haircuts...
