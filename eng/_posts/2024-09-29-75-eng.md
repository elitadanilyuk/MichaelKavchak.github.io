Hungry is not a brother
Prayer of the Satisfied 
Insincere. 
In a more eventful holiday, 
Because he is a grabber and a prick.

When someone has, he is bourgeois — 
The Bolsheviks taught that.
His judgments, he has spit, 
And hate with all your might.

American and Jew
Responsible for everything
(This is what beggars think).
Saved money — 
Now let's spend.
