I'm not Buddha
And not Christ. 
Do not call the paramedics.
My Verbal Diarrhea â€” 
More than hobbies, 
Knife from nightmares.
 
Not depression 
And not euphoria
Consciousness was taken over. 
To the goal 
Calls for hope,
So as not to jump, 
And quietly rejoiced.
 
To rejoice with you, 
And some of you are me,
In healthy words
At peace with love.
