Straw hat
And the traveler's assistant â€”
Shymic-thinker,
Homeless and beggar.
Drive away the romantic dreamer, 
He is garbage for society because he lives in the wrong way.

Rolled to the extreme 
He became a Darmoid.
And in a healthy reality
Impossible without deeds. 

To the search for truth 
Sleep tight.
You like to think
And the tents are bigger.
