No one heals like that 
Like Doctor over Doctors.
And no one will arrange
Like the rich over the rich.
 
And there is no better teacher 
Knife Teacher over Teachers.
He is everywhere, 
Inside and between us.
 
We breathe and live with it,
Only from Him really 
Learn. 
We should worship Him â€”
But not all of us recognize Him.
