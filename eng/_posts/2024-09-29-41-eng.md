Your video opening 
I see it for the third time.
I was hoping to get drunk
You contribute something of your own.

A piece of heart and soul 
The owner's word gives.
Whether it's prose or poetry —
To only be yours.

Artificial — dead, 
A copy is a corpse. 
The Living Sacrifice — 
In communication, marriage.
