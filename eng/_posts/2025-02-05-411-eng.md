The lettering disappears, the sound disappears,
And the memory, like a cloud, will disappear,
He later empties the creation of the hands,
And the ego will not get used to the changes.

For eternity clings, weaves a web,
Tries like that and tries hard.
And suddenly you run into the root cause
And the universe will clench into a fist.

The property is jealous of the owner,
Man seeks to surpass God.
Such a classic from time immemorial â€”
The confrontation of the heavenly and the earthly.
