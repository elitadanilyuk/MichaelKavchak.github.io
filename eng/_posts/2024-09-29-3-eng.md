Does anyone still think
What are we guilty of?
Russia is killing us
Because it forbids
Fight with her.

“You think,
Someone will say —
What kind of difference?
They would speak Russian.
I will speak for myself.
They would replace the Ukrainian with their song.
Even as a servant, even as a slave, 
But I will live.”

It came to “liberate”.
Destroy and select.
Such is his love 
To orphans and widows.
