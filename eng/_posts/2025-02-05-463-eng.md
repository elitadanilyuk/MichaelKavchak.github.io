Who is Abel?
Myth, legend, fiction.
In each ziagan, the stronger wins.
Survived means Cain
The saint was killed.
So, the worse wins.

Doushogubu — glory, compliments and honors
Pyramids, tombs and mausoleums.
Destroy a brother
Take the crown 
Satisfy because of her —
It turns out a sign of valor.

The real crown is for the victims,
For those who did not steal, 
Did not select 
And paid.
Love turned away 
Discouraged,
Who among the dead rebelled
And for the Kingdom he came to life.
