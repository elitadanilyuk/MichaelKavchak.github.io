“Ukraine is Russia”, 
Because it is written in Russian. 
Russia is not Ukraine.
So let's leave it that way.
 
Maybe enough fraternization?
With Stockholm Syndrome
Isn't it time to go back —
From slavery home?
 
Are slaves slave owners
Dreaming of becoming
Over countrymen's own?
 
Apparently, yes, 
For strangers 
They are beaten, 
And the Ukrainians, 
Entering the taste,
Typing on the crown, 
They drink their own blood.
