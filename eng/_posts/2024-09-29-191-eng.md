Parsing words
Develops intelligence.
Enchanting 
La vita mostra
Deprives 
Ignorance of the net
Eternity Rebus 
Successfully dissolves.
 
Let them be called 
I'm bored
Scrupulous Analyst, 
Talakunom â€”
Tunnel to Truth 
I will cut for myself
Not academicism with a broom,
And the words of Kyle.
 
It doesn't matter that the search
They ignore mine,
Pointless occupation 
Considering.
I hope that the tower
They will finish,
From the Creator and from the neighbor,
Running away from the word.
