Pronounced
In the minibus is a poem.
About the modern Kobzar they said:
“Let's not give a beggar and money.”
Pushed and driven away.

“So he advertised his collection.
He is looking for glory.”
Good thing I didn't read.
Hung up. 
No one knows about me.

Do you want to go further — 
Do not get carried away.
Be gray like everyone else. 
Adjust
Or walking, or taxi fees.
