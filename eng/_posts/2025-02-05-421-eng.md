To be happier than you really are —
Subconscious need to tone up,
A mood that no one would take away
With freedom and control of thought and voice.

Own the situation, do not fall victim 
Positive emotions will help
To pass where it is necessary, and somewhere to become stubborn,
Do not humiliate the girl and please the guy.

She made an effort to distribute herself
Clever, kind and fun —
Not long to wait —
They will call beauty the queen.
