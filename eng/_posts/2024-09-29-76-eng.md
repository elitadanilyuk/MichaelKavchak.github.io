Execution time — 
He gave his life.
You were paid. 
Done conscientiously 
Removed everything —
Wasted strength. 

Do you live? 
What to measure? 
Money is the standard.
Who are you? 
To verify, 
Finance will tell the background. 

Credit stories. 
Such an earthly pattern. 
And the heavens are accountable 
Overcoming 
In the belief of obstacles.
