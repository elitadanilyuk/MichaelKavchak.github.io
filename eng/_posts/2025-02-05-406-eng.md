Banana slices
Fried in oil
In the oven barely stewed,
Folded layers like waffles,
At high temperature ready

With raw potatoes among themselves 
Cheese with garlic and flour
As if with salt, crushed.
With skin, moderately crispy —
Ten minutes included

No one wanted to share —
It was so tasty:
I wanted to dream in the morning.
I have never tasted it, but I wanted to.
