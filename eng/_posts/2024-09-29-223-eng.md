Who, if not Gogh, 
Heir of Cain,
Cain and revenge?
The Abel of Truth awaits.
Boomerang Hate
Will fly back,
Although Cain is holy
And would look.

Evil chose?
Was he angry?
Was the bloodsucker given the bowl?
How are you not Cain?
Did you not type
Killer status?

Justice will return
Home from captivity
But it won't cost 
Without Armageddon.
