There was a word in the beginning
With a good start.
I am used to it —
It no longer hisses.
We put a point,
Made in general.
You don't need anything —
In the corner lies.

Rust covered, 
Mold eats.
And dries
Without it, the tongue.
Nasushchne is gone
And there is no strength
This is how it disappears
Without words man.

Something he says
It looks businesslike
Running, walking,
Something is writing, making noise.
Thinks Creates,
She doesn't know the meaning.
The stove will fill —
And it does not burn.
