The slap of fate does not come by surprise,
Experience warns about it.
Did you like the forbidden speck too much?
Do not want to let go?
Justice punishes 
And selects.

For prevention, naughty in favor of,
So that it does not get worse,
In order not to be lulled by conscience and conscience,
So that the daring creation does not forget about the Creator.

No man dictated the laws to Him, 
Which one has to live by.
Ignored them and did not accept â€” 
So it will be beaten.
