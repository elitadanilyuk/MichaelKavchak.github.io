Why be afraid of skeletons,
When are you a skeleton yourself?
And you can be scared. 

When among evil poets 
Appears 
Good poet,
Weathers 
The thought is disturbing.

Taking 
As an example of myself,
Changed for the better, 
Demonstrate â€”
A good skeleton is coming.
And run away from him forWhat?
