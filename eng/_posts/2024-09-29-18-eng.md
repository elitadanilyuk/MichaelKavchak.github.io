Inspect health, whether they are strong,
A summons to the meeting will be given
They will give to the family
The seal is stamped in the papers.

Bandits and hooligans,
Drunks and drug addicts
Romance and specialist
Waiting on the field
The best and worst garbage.

Nature purifies itself 
The accumulated evil in the world 
I want to get drunk with blood...
War... that's what it is.
