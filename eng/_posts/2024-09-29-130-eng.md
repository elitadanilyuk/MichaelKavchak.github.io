We each go our own way
With parallels and intersections,
Carefree and anxiously 
With the deceivers and with the honest. 
 
With bridges and tunnels 
Over the abyss, and beyond.
Sad and funny.
Leading or stepping in.
 
The road will end someday,
But not in a dead end,
And to be in the glory of the Creator,
Saying goodbye forever to evil.
