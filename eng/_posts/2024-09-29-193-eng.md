Merged together
Minutes and hours 
Floating relentlessly.
 
You do not notice the growth
Do you think
What you stay 
Where he was.
And you meet someone
And you don't even ask â€”
You will hear or read:
And you reached it.
 
Learned the language
Raised children,
He married and fornicated,
Many patients
Cured.
Well lived.
