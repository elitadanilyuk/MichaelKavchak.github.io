Mobilization.
The nation is tired. 
Not that motivation. 
They came for me too.
On the battlefield 
Heroes die 
For us with you.

For us cowards,
Runaways and evaders,
Friends are dying 
From the hands of the occupiers. 

You have to choose
Alone with Consciousness:
Give a shot
Do you follow your conscience?
