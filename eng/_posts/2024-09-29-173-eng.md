Today is a holiday — 
On this day he was born
Husband and dad,
You have to think of him as a grandfather.
I.
How to congratulate?
They try to know
What to give — 
It seems like a family.
 
Although everyone has known for a long time
To your own and strangers:
Annually asks
And that's enough for him
They would throw three times
Would have caught three times
And they would understand:
 
Not for glory 
The birthday boy,
And to remember,
What my parents had,
He was held,
He was played.
Blessing
They took it from him.
Spent.
