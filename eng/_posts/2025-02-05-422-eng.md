You asked for a nice write, 
Well, I'll try...
So sweet to talk to you
I consider fate a reward. 

I am not a poet and not an artist of words,
I only write primitive texts.
I hope that my speech
Capable of conveying feelings.

I want to say, for some reason
Following the example of Shakespeare's sonnets,
To speed up your heart rate
Only from joyful and tender moments.
