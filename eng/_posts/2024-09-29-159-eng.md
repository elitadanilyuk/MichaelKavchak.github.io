***Edited 
improved Ukrainian text for Russian mobilized for Baikal
(poet, composer, singer) ***

Received a subpoena
Surprise.
It was no joke.
Mother collected things
And quietly told me
The war is worth it.

You will go to a foreign country,
Bring a washing machine, —
Dad whispered: 
And how do we get a million, 
Let's buy “Lada”,
We will finish the house. 

... I can really hear it, 
Dreaming of a dream?
