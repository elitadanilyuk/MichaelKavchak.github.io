Among many friends
There will be envy 
Surrounded by enemies 
Someone will sympathize.
In tension
Relaxing incense 
Lack of feelings 
For soullessness 
Will chart.

It's here — hold on.
Absent is joy.
Go - let go,
Draws — dreams.

I merge with life,
From seeds to more.
I will give myself,
Taking it first.
