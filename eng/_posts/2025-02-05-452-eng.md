Do not combine the ram with meat cutlets,
Do not drink wine with milk.
Incompatible dishes are not only with labels,
They will not be accepted by the stomach itself.

Some combinations before separation are requested,
Water is not mixed with fire.
The wheels will not roll downhill by themselves.
They are twisted by a motor 
Or pulled by horse.

Engines and horses are different in nature,
As well as calling landmarks.
Let's recognize at the start before it's too late:
Not always two plus two is four.
