Each of us is a note for cacophony.
Together is a great orchestra.
The mosquito does not hear the whole symphony,
Imagination does not have a complete registry.

He considers his writing aimless
And not knowing about the great gift â€”
The cost of living by joint efforts
Will cause... palms to blow...

Listen...
Around and Inside Music:
Mountains, sand, elephants.
Thunder in the sky, snapping a button,
Feather rustling 
and whispers of war.
