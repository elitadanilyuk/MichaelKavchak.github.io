The sound covers the space
KvyK has covered the process.
The eye of the eyelid asks to close
Vaxed — covered, anointed.

Vector distance to cover
AGE — covering years. 
Cover — pass, skip,
The ROT missed —
So he ate.

ScrewВ — missed the screw,
TratiV — missed what I had 
The wire is passed like a probe.
Kretka drew 
(missed).
What is Kretka —
Someone knew, someone didn't know.
