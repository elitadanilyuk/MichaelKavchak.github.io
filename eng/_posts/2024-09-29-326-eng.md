When not touched,
There are no challenges —
You atrophy.
Life is movement.
The war is coming,
And you are building,
You protect yourself,
Strengthens the spirit.

It's hard. You can't pass through.
No one envies, 
Yes, and they turn away.
Believe they want you to win, 
Faith is needed — without it you break.

Alien and own, 
Especially my own.
So let it not go out — 
In the faith of life!
