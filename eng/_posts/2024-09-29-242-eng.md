I thank the Creator,
I cling to life.
He measured,
And I resist. 

Cheerfulness and sleep
Surface and bottom 
As a doctor and lawyer, 
Lost and taken.
Refrigerator, TV,
Global and scarce.

To the dental passage 
Children of the family, 
You carry a salary,
Sweat and do it.
Tear and grab
Just don't die.
