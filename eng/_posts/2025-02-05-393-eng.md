Fierce position. Radicalism.
The cemeteries are crowded with crosses.
Fascism or communism,
Trumpism or Putinism
The corridors are prepared for the peoples of destiny.

You complain about the choice of the wrong predecessors —
They brought grief, suffering and trouble.
You fence yourself off, you will find intermediaries —
Let them vote, and I won't go. 

Timelessness is also radical.
There are even more graves from her.
Meaningful choices and wise activities 
For the good, they encourage the accumulation of strength.
