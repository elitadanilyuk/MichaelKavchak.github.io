(Brother's poem. For relaxation)
 
What kind of beast is there on the edge of the forest
Does it rattle and go? 
This is the same car from Kutaisi, 
It is called “Colchida”. 
 
Tears from under itself and rumbles 
Look — smoke is blowing. 
Only does not want to go, 
But it's good that it's buzzing.
 
Lucky — I overclocked
He also runs from the Horba — 70.
I walked along the way,
Impossible to equalize.
 
Driver on the left — she is on the right 
Then directly and vice versa.
For a second, somewhere fixed, 
And again, the steering wheel in fists. 

 
Noises, buzzes and just jumps, 
The poor driver almost cries.
The spare part hangs on the nozzles
And the board will soon depart. 
 
This car is a miracle!
Head like a camel,
The dragon's tail crawls
He also carries something on himself.
 
And a car as a car. 
And a full tank of gasoline.
And a spark like a pea,
And it does not start in any way. 
 
SuLyma, Gerus and Kavchak —
They have already studied “Colchida”.
And everyone in it is now a mustache, 
At least the whole world will pass on it.
