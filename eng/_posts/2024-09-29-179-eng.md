Only I love you, â€” 
I heard my ears.
But now I know
What do they mean
Your eyes are sad.
 
Why are they looking for someone,
Without me noticing.
Now, unfortunately, I know
Why avoid
Friends,
Trust-inducing.
 
Why from division
The most cherished,
From the happiness of the dearest
You become secluded,
Your own happiness
And alien 
Powder.
