Laid in nature
More energy, 
Knife in pictures. 
The structure of the soul is visible. 
You hear the elegy 
From the inside of man. 
 
Photography — 
This is the cross section
Torn moment
Albeit beautiful, 
Hides helplessness.
Breathless lies.
 
However, even in the living — 
The artist is a threat.
Causes oscoma
Splint attachment.
