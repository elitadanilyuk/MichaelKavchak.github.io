In the porthole
Inspects his 
Dictator-
Expropriator.
His ego 
Raised 
Above Heaven. 
 
From whom else to choose
How to become more famous?
He needs a lot,
As if he were not going to die,
As if he had risen forever. 
 
His greatest interest is 
So that the business does not destroy it,
To prove your greatness,
Take God for the beard.
