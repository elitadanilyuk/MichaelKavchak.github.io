Lord, I could have lost her
I could have lost her
That is the sum of my loves.
I could have gone to another fate,
Where else in bed to howl
(Or maybe even snoring)
Not happiness, but a cluster of disappointments.

At your personal direction 
Just for her, thank you. Thank you!
For love, so pure.
Thank you. And thank you again. 

I am not a hero, because she left for me
And not because I found it. 
Thy works are marvellous,
It is your parental love.
