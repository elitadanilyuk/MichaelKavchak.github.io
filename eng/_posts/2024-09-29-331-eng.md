Walked along the edge,
We stumbled, rolling into the abyss.
Would stop the satellite
However, we push.
They push us too
We hate and kill.

Grasping for Biden, Macrons and Cheeks
Or maybe there will be some interesting ones among us?
The Slovaks betrayed, the trick of the Hungarians, 
Thai Polish farmers are not very friendly to us.

In people it is not true
There is anxiety in the world.
Over Humanity a Sledgehammer
And hope in God.
