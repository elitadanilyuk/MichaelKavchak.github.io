Eyes turn away
To see the truth 
Refuse. 
Serve them 
Only pleasant 
At first glance,
And bright and dark 
As if not near. 

Pushing 
From the darkest
In the direction 
To the brightest
Wider 
You are aware of the truth
Ego-eggs 
You split the crack.

You are not surprised by the birth 
And you rejoice in death
When Eternity 
It will be felt 
Before you meet.
