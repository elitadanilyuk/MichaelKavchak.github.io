Waiting. 
And you, hiding outside the window, watching,
Do I have 
You need it.
It dawns. 
And as much as you embarrass me,
Very interesting sky.

Will you go unnoticed or will you be invited to the house?
Run away or shoot with a hug.
Dictate the words â€” will they be written down? 
Will advice be accepted or rejected?
Despised, or left in the heart?

I will notice, call,
I'll hug and write.
And the slogan and the parable
I will leave it to the descendants.
