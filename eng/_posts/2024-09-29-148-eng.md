And one in the field a warrior, 
If it has the spirit of Samson.
He will find the right weapon.
For attack and for defense.
 
It has the greatest power.
Tongue double-sided sword â€” 
The word wall breaks,
When the truth is true.
 
Before him is a liar and a thief
Hands down.
5 people or 6 peoples
They throw down arrows and bows.
