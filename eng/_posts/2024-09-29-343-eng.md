Time is gone, and that's the first second.
When she was born, she died immediately. 
Yes, this is not the end.
It's just the beginning of the minute.

In a minute you will have a lot
But it will also fade away.
However, do not regret, because it lasts an hour...
The hour is gone, you get a day
Even the night after him.
Glad to have lived all the time.

Seven days were gathered,
It's time to relax
The day off has come â€”
The week is over...
Look at the moon.
Having appeared out of nowhere,
It is filled with light
And it will be squandered...
To extend the year...
