To exist on the knees of a slave,
They carry free wings. 
For freedom they go to die, 
They die, but they live. 

On your knees you take the yoke, 
Not killed, but are you alive? 
You drive your people into captivity, 
Because you go to her first.

On your knees you seem to be
To serve eternal evil.
Unless you're fighting for the truth â€”
On my knees I go to God.
