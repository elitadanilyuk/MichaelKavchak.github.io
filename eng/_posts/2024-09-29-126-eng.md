Code of the Builder of Communism
It didn't work,
10 commandments 
Ignorated. 
The firm hand of Stalinism 
Again, the people demanded.
Lack of other ideas 
All that they could was abandoned. 
 
Aggressor and victim 
In their own they steal,
They complain about corruption. 
Conscience is dead, 
Dictatorship is called
Although they know more thoroughly about the way out. 
 
Do not wish on the neighbor
Do not think about adultery
Do not falsely testify, 
Don't steal, don't kill 
Respect your parents
Saturday, be vigilant.
Avoid idols, 
Do not use the name of God in vain. 
Believe in Him and honor Him.
