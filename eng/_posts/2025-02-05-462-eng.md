The gait is proud, and the eyes are glassy —
Body language still betrays.
Success has been achieved, no victories yet. 
He chooses the victim, he weighs. 

Black leaders are needed 
To be afraid of them —
On land, in the sky and on the water 
Teach discipline to hold on. 

Morality is lacking — we need a stick.
The state and the scepter will be given in hand.
When the ruler bites too much — 
They will also remove him from the throne.
