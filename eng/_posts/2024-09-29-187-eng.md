Your own shirt
Closer to the body. 
And what is not a country, 
That's your interest.
And the sharpening of the chopstick
To fly away, 
Above all is needed
Will from heaven. 
 
To fight Ukraine, 
Corruptors did not steal,
To allies 
Persistently sought,
Even if the presidents
New ones were chosen. 
 
Maybe it's worth America, 
To wake up to Europe,
With the help of Pause.
And then,
In order to prevent disaster,
Turn on again.
