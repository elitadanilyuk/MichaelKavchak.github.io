Someone likes it
Deprived of foundation
Ukrainian
Without native language.

Door without lock
A house without doors, 
Mouth without tongue â€”
Prey LeGKA
For insidious people. 

A courtyard without a gate
On the bushes without boots,
Without a flashlight at night,
Without a soul.
Because the words are alien.
