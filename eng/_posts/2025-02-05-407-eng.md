Homework done for children,
Problems are not solved, but deepened.
In lazy hiding
The good are not in a hurry
And trouble beckons.

Beloved son
(And thoughts about Vkraina),
Look for strength in yourself
Try it yourself, 
So that you do not get bitten,
To fight back is treacherous
At you, the dogs are being bullied.

Do not blame the help 
Someone else's procrastination.
Thank you for the victories
From his own laziness to his repentance.
