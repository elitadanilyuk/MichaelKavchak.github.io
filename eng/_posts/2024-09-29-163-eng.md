Do you think of me 
Smoking a cigarette
You call it a failure. 
Without seeing the letter, you read the newspaper. 
He is angry with himself, 
Because you don't know me. 
 
You can't go away from the window. 
You look like me.
You won't do anything
This pain will not go away. 
 
Alcohol does not disappoint 
Anasha will not save.
That's the life of the barricade 
Destroys the SOUL!
