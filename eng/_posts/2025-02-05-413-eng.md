Hope and be fulfilled — in retrospect:
The later, the more. 
Delayed higher quality.
Patience is not weakness.
Hurry for the worse
And the prudent are often happy.

I know what I want 
And I would like to.
Success is requested
Presses and drives.

Not too hasty, but did not miss either.
The hunter is the one who shoots accurately:
For a split second — hit, fell.
However, that moment is long in coming.
