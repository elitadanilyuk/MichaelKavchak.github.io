Sewing time and breed time 
Plan and ignore.
In the face of threats 
Become opposite. 
Work
And go to bed. 
 
To the circumstances 
Conditions will come.
But you do not always recognize the conditions.
A lot of chaff,
So far, you combine all the intentions.
 
God will give a day 
God will give you food
And will tell you the right plan. 
And you will get fresh,
And will not cut
Ideological bedlam.
