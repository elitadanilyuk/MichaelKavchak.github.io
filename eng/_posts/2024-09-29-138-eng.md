It's delicious to spit
In the face of legal
State Supervision.
 
With a cigarette over the pit 
Proclaim: 
Glory to Ukraine! 
 
Slide to the bottom
From the finger on the wallet 
The weapon of death. 
 
To be on the lists 
Archives of crimes,
By taking care of the led.
 
Enter the hearts of the weakened
Gratitude for freedom.
... by the force of opposition.
