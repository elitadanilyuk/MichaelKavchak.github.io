Where does the idea come from?
Yesterday I prepared the soil for her.
Now my field is sold,
The invisible farmer knew what he was buying.

Fertile for sport, science or singing,
War or love, money or trouble —
To the mountain of the pole or fall into the abyss —
My new host will sow thoughts.

Grain will germinate. Weed or uprooted —
Depends on me and the neighboring gentlemen.
Rooting to the top or climbing into the ditch —
In the will of micro- and macroworlds.
