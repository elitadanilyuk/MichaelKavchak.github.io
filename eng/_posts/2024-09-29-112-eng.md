B bed Do not lie down for a long time, 
The body needs movement.
Thoughts with an idea, in a word
Suddenly awakens the spirit.
 
It would seem that everything works, 
Nothing flows anywhere. 
New Ideals Draws 
A soul, because she wants more.
 
Nourishes the body first 
And then take the spirit. 
The soul cannot do without action, 
Its element is perpetual motion.
