It does not always work out 
As I wish.
I want peace, but there is no peace. 
Sometimes you just have to wait 
Month after month, winter will disappear.
 
Truly a joy 
Deep dive, 
In the form of unshakable peace,
With hope in her wide,
Battered with stones of suffering.
 
Therefore, having gathered with our forces,
Having spread mightily with wings,
With happy thoughts
Actively wait without hesitation.
