And Shelom and Vanya,
And Jana and Jeanne
Late or early
Life will be forbidden.

A soul, or a maniac,
Cool, or botany
Peacefully or fearfully
In the monastery, or on the Titanic.

They line up in front of the throne —
As if they were the same.
Someone is being written off,
And someone —
In the embrace of eternity.
