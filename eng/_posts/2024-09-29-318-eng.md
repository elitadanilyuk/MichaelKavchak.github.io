Separated from God and neighbor,
You get a lot of enemies.
The environment in you hears a lot,
And you wanted harmony with him.

Understand yourself —
Harmonie ou dominació
When it comes to your requests, 
Selfish and stingy
Are you just waiting for a hug?

Harmony is not in drinking, 
And in balanced proportions.
In smoothing protrusions
And in the patched holes.
