I'm catching you 
You catch me.
You scare the fearless. 
Catching yesterday's future, 
And yesterday's tomorrow
In a sacred place,
What is called Nowhere.
 
We are a whole herd —
You won't see anyone.
The road is wide —
Fields and forests.
On the spot runner
Legless.
Blind brown-eyed — 
Ugly beauty.
 
Without edge and borders
The timid brave.
Circled chain.
From linear networks
In a pile, whipped lengthwise,
Caught immense
Spirit without explanation.
