I'll tell you the words 
Correct,
The instruction is great
For you, 
Because you are wounded
And you lack a word.

The wife reproaches:
“You teach others well,
And he himself sneaks,
And how no one sins.”

Rights. 
And who will dispute?
I'm a loser, I admit it.
And in the depths of the soul says:
“I give the word.”
