Die attacking
Whether protecting â€” 
The choice is clear: 
Hell or paradise.
Cain is victorious,
The world acquiring, 
Lose yourself. 

The leader or the tail,
Master or slave, 
Of the two only marinas 
Recognize at least,

What is beneficial to you 
High for a year 
Or for age...
From Life to become banished
The man decides...
