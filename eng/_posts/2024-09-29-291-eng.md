For the fight in the Donetsk ring
Billions of angels are watching. 
They don't care when in the first minute 
And in the first round

Goliath knocks David down.
It's not a show. 
Let the disgust grow first
To the aggressor who came with the sword. 

Let the armies cover,
Fears will pass between states
Every intention will be rethought
Before the stone flies.
