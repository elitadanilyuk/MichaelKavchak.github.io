Lottery of Fate. The rocket flies to the Dnieper.
The tree fell on the house,
Someone was lucky, but someone was not lucky —
Didn't even get to the start.

Run away or wait motionless —
Your personal will not pass away.
Over the ocean, at work or at home —
Very happy or sad.

They take off anxiously for minutes and hours,
Panic in Florida.
Milton* bears great ruins —
In the journey we have a attraction.
