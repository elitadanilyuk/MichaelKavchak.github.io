Bitten cat 
Or aged 
I want to give 
Mother Nature,
So don't be surprised
When and you
Scaled 
And the victim 
Quit 
On occasion.

Do not complain
Loneliness is cruel
And ungrateful loved ones.
And take a look 
On the situation 
On the other hand,
Let's get up 
Above the problem above.

The planet is trying
With your eyes
To see the sun —
Once Born
Back Returns
To her explain:
The life of a star,
What she rejected — 
What is it?
