There are firewood people,
Which are burned, 
To keep others warm.
They are like heroes, 
Then praise 
And they forget 
More and more. 

Therefore, they try 
Survive, 
Choose to avoid 
Become a victim.
Truthfully, 
But dead.

Only the conscious know 
What awaits them at the top.
Deaths of Fear
It is necessary to overcome
Question: How?
