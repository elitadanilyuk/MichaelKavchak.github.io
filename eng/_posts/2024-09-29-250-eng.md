Today in inspiration 
Weekend.
Not because 
What is tired,
And I'm for him 
Closed, angry.
Suspended, 
Upset.

And slept as if well
Not very disturbed by the dream
And in memory 
Something responded, 
The word stumbled,
Not so brave
From the image of barriers. 

Not mine, but mine. 
Was for someone 
Not so.
The word is inspired,
Sorry,
I'm angry with myself.
