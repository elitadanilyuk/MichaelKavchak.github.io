But the pooch still drinks blood.
She calmed down, did not flee to Russia.
The slowed mine will still do its thing â€”
Until now, the loyal ones still feel sorry.

The collaborator changed shoes, became a patriot,
She is in the vanguard of independence.
At the first opportunity, I remembered Russian.
With the rest, caution so far.

The fifth column is waiting underground.
She is among us.
The aggressor takes care of her
Because he uses it more than once.
