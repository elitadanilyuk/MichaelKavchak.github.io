Every end begins somewhere,
It is not forever to wear a crown to the king.
Good has a pole, which is called evil.
Like the wand of evil, it has a good ending.

Do not be sad, because once it was joyful,
Do not regret, because you will get consolation.
And the enemy will be envious
From your happy laugh.

And do not envy yourself,
For they are small and frail 
In gratitude to fate â€”
Source of miracles.
