In the world of miracles, it is more difficult to surprise,
A tsunami of news and sensationalism is coming.
Can recognize just Demiurge better?
Let it rise above the waves and not be swept away.

Yes, no, we are interested in the center of the hurricane itself,
The core of the planet and the limits of boundaries.
We don't have enough ocean depths
And the number of stars in telescopes too.

Wear patience,
You are just like God.
To remain a creation — 
Your nature.
Absorbs and reflects 
All around a drop —
He will take care of her
Result and Cause.
