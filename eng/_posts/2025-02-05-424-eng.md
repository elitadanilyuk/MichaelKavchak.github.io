Fate seized with tweezers - you will not break out,
Some by the neck, some by the sides, some by the knee.
You twist, spin, and finally stop â€”
Stop screaming and cling to the walls.

From happiness, he sang in this cage of the habitual,
The will is forced to live as you wish.
For a serf there is nothing more sad,
Rather than freedom to breathe, you ask for slavery.

All in the face of the facts of new situations, 
Under the pressure of changes in life.
In kaleidoscopes of favorite situations 
Good or bad, look in your head.
