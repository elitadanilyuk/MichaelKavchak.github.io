On the edge is placed between the left and the right,
A long time ago, the center became between them.
Constantly plowed by evil neighbors,
Dreamed of independence
Sometimes small.

For a short time. While the hordes are descended
Insulted and ashamed
The forces gathered,
The plows were made and the swords were broken
But they secretly made plans for revenge.

The resurrected empires did not pity the people,
They incited the propaganda of the fire,
Harnessed again the iron horses,
In a new way, the limits.
