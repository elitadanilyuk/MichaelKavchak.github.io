Why do you need to apologize? 
They have not met you. 
Regret 
But they do not blame. 
So somewhere the plans have been shared 
For the rest, they are spent.
Let's keep hoping.
 
God willing, we will meet again. 
Maybe in better conditions.
Let's have a better conversation
In future meetings.
 
Sometimes and tease 
Not a sin
To torture someone
I could not immediately.
