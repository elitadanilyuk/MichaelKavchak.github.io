Ivan ZELot
He lives in ME. 
Constantly in myself 
I wear it.
Sometimes says 
Words of inspiration, 
When I wash
Or not ProShu. 
 
I like to listen to him â€” 
Wise advisor.
Offers 
Destroy the thought,
Weeds
Nursery Ideas. 
 
Thank you, Ivan,
What do you care so much.
Especially at night,
When I sleep, 
And you are working...
