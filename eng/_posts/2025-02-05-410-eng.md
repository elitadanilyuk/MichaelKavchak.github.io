I want everything at once,
For the beginning and then the end,
In the first minute of ecstasy,
Not an excavator, but a pencil.

Maybe then you won't be born —
To believe that eternity has lived?
Zero to enjoy
Without sowing and without harvest?

You sweat, you sweat, you overeat and you're hungry,
Do you go to war or get bored in paradise?
To stretch in time is the plan of the Lord,
From nothing 
To everything —
And constantly in battle.
