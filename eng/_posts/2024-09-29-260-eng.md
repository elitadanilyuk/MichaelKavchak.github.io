Not an epigraph with an explanation
What will be read,
And not the menu that I eat
And a warning,
What's on the trays 
Souls will give us
The power to live in them
Energy from the Creator 
And the Truth.

At the level of sensations
What we do not smell
We see or hear,
Taste or touch —
We don't just exist
And we always consume
Donated by someone.
In agony, someone suffered
And we TOLERATE.

Don't just breathe
And don't just live
With the community or quietly —
Tear from yourself,
Gifted by someone
Take care and appreciate
To the heart is directed
Hug and kiss.
