Lack of hope from day to day,
Emptiness, no expectations,
The inappropriateness of funny songs,
Avoiding chatter about happiness.

There is no one to listen to and no faith,
From lack of light lost in caves
What kind of spring is there? 
Trap and prison.
We took the oars anchored on the galleys.

To an individual and to the whole people 
Only love for all of us â€”
From death a guide 
To go free.
