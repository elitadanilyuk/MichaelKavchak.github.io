There is someone to equate to 
But in spite of everything 
We must remain ourselves,
Carrying your own is no stranger. 
 
The stranger does not hurt like his own. 
And someone else's joy is not yours. 
May your desire not be extinguished, 
Be yourself to oblivion. 
 
Respect and honor your brother, 
Encourage him at all times. 
How grief will not come with you, 
You take it harder every time.
