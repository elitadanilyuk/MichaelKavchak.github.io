Unreachable star
...
The Shepherd and the King
On top and throne 
Envelops restlessness â€”
Primitive desires turn into immodest,
Steps jump across the sky.

The current one does not suit.
Artificial intelligence is calling for help,
Listening to the Primordial 
Insures,
To bring DiVA to the status of the usual.

In spite of all the faults
Symbol of Eternity
Eight tries 
Become a troika.
Inflatable,
A penny dreams of growing in hryvnia.
A finger reaches out to the finger of God,
To conflate the Creator with the Creator of the like.
