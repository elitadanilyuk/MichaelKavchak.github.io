I am the word
Between me and bills, 
I am icons and I am home
I-Images 
And I am things,
Architectures
And overtures,
Between the shepherds 
And I am shepherds.
 
The word is eternal, 
Farewell and counterpoint.
Healed and mutilated
It began and ends.
Ends to begin,
He dies to be resurrected.
 
Running away from hatred 
To love,
To get carried away
With her arms,
I am in the word.
After him, the hunter 
And caught by him.
