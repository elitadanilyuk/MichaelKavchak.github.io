On the edge of the abyss is confessed —
Back to her.
So a step forward, or a step back —
And we, the Prometheans —
Swans from ugly ducklings
Or the year of the mountain trophy —
We become characters
Parable and ballad.

You are a co-author,
Even though there was a plan about you.
You are a listener and speaker
Other people's programs.

Behind the stand Confirm
Or you deny —
You can hold the idea
Or take off.
