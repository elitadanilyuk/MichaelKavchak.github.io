I don't know if you believe in blessings,
In your New Year's in particular. 
And a new talk was opened in me,
Poems are constantly getting words.

It is difficult to restrain thoughts that are important
They run free, they rush out. 
Impatient, hot, quick-witted, timid. 
Where they were stacked, they no longer lie.

Sow grain, maybe something will yield. 
They sowed in me â€” I gathered in the grains. 
Or maybe fate will reward me?
Maybe I'll put it where I took it.
