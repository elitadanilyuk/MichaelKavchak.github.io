The age of living, the age of learning.
That is, take from the environment.
Accumulate knowledge someday
With the need to pronounce them. 

And let no one need
What I said to myself 
Get out and come home
More perfect phrases.

Accept from others, honor teachers, 
Owe them wise words,
To finally understand for himself:
The best advisor for you is yourself.
