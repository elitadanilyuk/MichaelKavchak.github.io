Not just a source.
Caught in the blood, 
The very soul of the planet
Cleans toxins
Strengthens and resurrects.
Zivʼyanuti leaving bouquets,
Hurry to the sea with the ocean.

To be raised to the clouds from there to the sky
Earth's soul (and what would you call it?)
I took the energy from the sun, 
Going back down,
She gave it to the soil.

Zivʼiane our bouquet.
Or with a taste of happy,
What on Earth Life Project
Was it impossible without us?
