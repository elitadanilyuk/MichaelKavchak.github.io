Nearer the end than I think of it
Eyes, Michael, open, understand:
Do you brag about debts, or a stuffed amount?
How to recognize: someone else's treasure or yours?

Take a look and see how often they get confused.
They select, appropriate the stolen.
They pretend to be their own and do not repel,
They believe that they will not be remembered by God.

Better give,
Consider your knife.
Michael, be vigilant,
So that they are not transmitted to the sky 
And they did not name 
Guilty.
