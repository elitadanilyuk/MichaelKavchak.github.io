The patriot loved the motherland
Nationalists are their own people. 
The Nazis rid the country of foreigners.
Fascism is the arbitrariness of bastards.

Fascism is the conquest of territories.
Nazism is filtering its own.
Nationalism is the veneration of heroes
Patriotism is an idea of love. 

They come to love in different ways
Sitting on the veranda or in the tank:
In a state of gentle bliss
Or hating everyone and themselves.
