The mirror is designed to examine itself
And keep an eye on the environment.
Pieces of the sun are tearing for someone,
It scares some, and encourages others.

Disposable mirrors all around,
But one important thing is built inside.
You look at him again and again
You scan your own, hidden from others. 

Paths are cut
Mirrors in the eyes 
Differences are sought
In friends and in enemies.
