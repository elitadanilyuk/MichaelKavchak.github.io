Slept poorly
Couldn't sleep
Dropped the blanket
Lazy to get up
Adjust
Thermostat 
One degree.

Lazy would drive away
If I ran out
To the basement without shoes
To save yourself 
And take care of your relatives
In order to avoid losses,
So that an accident does not happen. 

I Hear Guilty
Behind the armpits to God.
Because no one should sleep â€”
Awaken the alarm.
