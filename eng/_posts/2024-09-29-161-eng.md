The rib on the chest is torn, 
Undrunk bottle in hand.
To die or to live is “very strange.”
Chest in orders
Or the head in the bushes.
 
And how do you fight with such,
Believing in him a man,
If you do not feel at the slaughterhouse — 
As if you were stuffing meat,
You shoot and cut cattle.
 
It has to be temporarily
Encourage yourself.
Voluntary or forced,
Overcoming fatigue,
Unlock funds 
The border,
To return home.
