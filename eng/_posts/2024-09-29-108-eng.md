We are cool — 
We feed the whole world
Without us, they are nothing. 
And we ourselves? 
We do not need
Help them, or what?
 
Everyone needs greatness, 
Alpha male status.
You can only hide your glory 
Without edge and end. 
 
Widows and orphans are waiting
To take care of them too.
They will feel the smell of mercy —
Pikha prays from himself.
