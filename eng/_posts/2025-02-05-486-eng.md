Dreams have changed with reality
I want to fall asleep instead of waking up.
In dreams I get drunk with joy
So that one day the anxiety is absorbed again.

Would you like to call dreams life
Nightmares of the days are a fog of sleep
They said that to live is to suffer,
When I sleep, I'm really alive.

Not on those terminals the cables were thrown,
Reality and dreams are confused.
Hands of war, something you have bent,
Move back my poles.
