@@ My home — 
Where I found peace. 
Not in the guest, 
Not in prison and not in employment.
Where he got rid
Eye slavery
And the poorest
Extreme castes.
 
Where finally
Truth met
And I realized:
 
My home — 
Where I found peace. 
In the guest,
In prison and in hiring,
In the slavery of the eyes,
In the richest
The poorest
Extreme castes.
