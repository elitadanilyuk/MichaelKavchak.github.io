Not that hearing, the sight fades,
Teeth are getting smaller every time.
Termination of the mountains,
The fullness of days completes itself.

Young people, it seems to her 
The old are old and born
To stay in your journal, 
They had fun between them. 

Merry old age is also a treasure
If you look for it from youth.
In mosaics of various colors
The most important rebus to solve.
