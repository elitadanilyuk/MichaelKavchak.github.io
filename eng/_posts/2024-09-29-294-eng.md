Looking does not mean seeing
I listened, I didn't always hear. 
He said he did, but in fact he partied,
You think you lived, think you were.

To see is to understand, 
To hear — to be interested, 
To do — to want, 
To live is to glorify

God and neighbor,
Loneliness and the world
Do not collect excess, 
And bear fruit.
