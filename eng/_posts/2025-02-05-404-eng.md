I invite you to the party as a friend 
Although jealousy tears the two of us apart,
The extreme tension between us
Everyone suffers deeply.

I emphasize artificial indifference
Attractive charisma
Strangers diligently flatter
With iron aging.

With the intention of breaking a nerve
The most important thing in the world
I'm the first one ready now
Quickly fly to him.
