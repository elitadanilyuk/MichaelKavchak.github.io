Cold sweat in a terrible dream —
A vaccine against reality,
To wake up happy 
Rejoice in the ordinary
Which was already annoying,
Now in its banality
It became attractive.

Deprived in prison, emaciated 
Moved to your native land.
He is not divorced with love, he is not detained for slander,
Drinkable and full —
What is not paradise?

There is truth in the world.
If not in reality,
Where they fight and walk beaten,
Then in a dream I will find her.
