Valentine's Day 
From the point of view of men (-:
 
My second half,
The content of life is fullness 
You lead quickly to the goal, 
And without you, the goal is not the same.
 
You â€” to the handle of the ax,
Cogs to the key.
For writing ink,
For the lonely body, the soul.
 
For weakened capacity,
Fuel for the engine.
You drive away loneliness
That's why you're so expensive.
