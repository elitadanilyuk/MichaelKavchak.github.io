You don't write
They won't write to you either.
And it's not worth it then 
Complain about loneliness.
From Confinement 
Remain themselves
Missed days
Aware of irreversibility.

Life is boiling 
From enemies and friends
Relationships 
Add vigor
Do not allow to sit 
In the skhimnitsky lane,
Many of them are useful. 

Harm â€” 
Too many enemies
Especially among these, 
As a reward, 
Try to look for comrades.
