Inspiration like with orca beer 
Drink in peacetime.
There is no inspiration — no miracle,
Shout, run, or shake.

But it is worth the soul to burn 
Love or anger at evil —
Enough grenade to whip
In a poisonous snake dome.

Orcs dozens at once 
For a piece, inspiration breaks.
The gluttonous will destroy the infection,
The path to life will be paved.
