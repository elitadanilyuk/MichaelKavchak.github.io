Spectacular sports
For glory in the people.
Burn health
Shorten lives.
Sacrifice of time and strength
For medals on the chest.
Someone needs it
Rubbish for someone.

Strengthen health
Drive away stress
Shake the body
Cleanse the spirit â€” 
No need to be bullied 
To raise the tone.
It's not a race that helps 
And measured movement.

The choice is yours 
What are you missing?
Cheerfulness of spirit
Do hard labor exercises? 
Sport can and will glorify 
And it will surely destroy,
Charging, albeit modest,
He will keep what he had.
