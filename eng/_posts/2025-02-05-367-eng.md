To steal — to get rich
Took the earthly for safekeeping.
He transferred the property into money,
Krav, as he knew,
Until the end of age.

He gained fame, became a politician —
Reigned 
Above the peoples,
But I didn't think
That he robbed himself,
He even went to heaven.
According to the awards.

Stole from everyone,
And most of all in yourself.
I couldn't steal
Neither God nor heaven.
