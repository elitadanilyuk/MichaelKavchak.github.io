The language of flowers will tell a lot.
It is not in vain that they choose a bouquet.
Accident narrows and imposes
For the artist to read and the poet.

Romantic and dreamer
Dreaded or in love,
Passing by, they stop, 
About the thoughts of the forgotten ones,
They look closely at the petals. 

Here is the parallel of your essence,
Pay and take in handfuls.
Give and from the depths of primacy
Speak grass and flowers without words.
