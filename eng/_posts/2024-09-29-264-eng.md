Sworn in friendship,
Yes for the duel
They were looking for pistols
With mutual tension,
Breaking the labels. 

Capability 
To many capacities — 
Etiquette. 
Detection in contradictions
Identities —
Friendship is a priority. 

Save your friends
And save cartridges
When murderous illusions
Eliminate obstacles.
