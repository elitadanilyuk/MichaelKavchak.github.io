You're going and you don't know
Where it will fly. 
You play with death,
Drills in the mind. 

On people safari 
Satan has arranged
Satan in the heat
He called the Ukrainians.

At first glance 
Divided his kingdom.
Not at all 
It does not stand.
And what they do here 
Ukrainians of Metarstvo?
From cursing siphons
Separate them.
