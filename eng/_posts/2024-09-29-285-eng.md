I'm not 
In countries, cities and villages,
Among those who beat, who beat,
In the company of sad and cheerful
Except where I am.

I'm thinking about myself, about my family,
About food, about water and air
About the micron and the universe, about God and despair,
About the living and the dead, about the rich and the poor.

In my thoughts in countries, cities and villages,
Among those who beat, who beat,
In the company of sad and cheerful
The excitement is mine. 
Everything is filled with me 
And attracted to me.
Who's to say I'm not there? 
The universe is me. 
I AM!
