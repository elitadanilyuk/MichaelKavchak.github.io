Constant comfort corrupts.
Come, problem, gratitude for my refreshment.
Fighting with you makes your well-being complete,
Make me perfect and run to others.

You strengthen your calling
Weak and fragile
No nipple in the cradle
And with porridge in a bowl,
Circle board at school
And on football.
The exercise is written
And the book is read â€”
Easy and accessible has become difficult.

The sin of complaining about challenges-difficulties,
On the real invisible teachers.
They add patience and courage,
Form a hero, as I wanted.
