Falling Stars — 
Replace the hat. 
You will break yourself — 
They will catch you. 
Sparks from above 
As if putting a point
Without the beginning of time —
A hint of heaven.
 
Eternity writes — 
Read,
Happened attentively 
To her lessons.
Spacious or tight —
Collect,
To be achievable
True peace.
 
On the ground 
Falling star, 
Dissolved and extinguished,
You won't find her.
And broke through the dark
Dome hole.
In due time
Through her
You will fall into the sky.
