Two Truths on the Battlefield
They talk about the truth.
We are with you
And they don't ask.
One selects,
The other does not let go
And we are with you
Death devours.

Too little was revealed 
Go to visit
The encroachment has poured out
In the beast of anger.

Strangers to own
And keep yours
It's true to kill
And truly survive.
