Turtles burrow into the mud
Let the eagle rise above the clouds,
They are afraid of sharks in the seas, 
Flocks graze on the uplands.

And the man, 
Pilot, miner or shepherd,
Submersible submarine,
He does not calm his spirit, 
Reign is the main reason.

Beyond the threshold of the universe,
What's going on there?
Until he becomes God, 
Do not calm down.
