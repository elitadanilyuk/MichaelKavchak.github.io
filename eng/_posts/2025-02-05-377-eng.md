Understand yourself.
Learn to hear your inner voice.
Not the one that destroys 
Ourselves and strangers,
And the one that will build 
The nucleus and the cosmos.

Piercing, scratching, Find a weakness in the shell of the egg,
From scratch 
To enter eternity
And enter a space without borders, without end.

You can't do without intuition.
The voice of the inside and the call from the outside
Evaluate one day â€”
Their words are silent.
