English was imposed,
Spanish spread
Nor is it without blood and genocide. 
And the Moscow people, 
Not one ethnic group dug more than one hole 
Causing grief, murder and poverty.

It is necessary to have an international
If without coercion, 
When she asks for herself â€”
My family will be rich
Strangers will not bear 
Does not spray.

For death or for life 
Two Civilizations.
And your language
For good or for destruction?
