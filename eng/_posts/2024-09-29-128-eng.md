Quantity or quality?
He gave birth to many children, 
I collected a lot of money,
Wrote a lot of articles. 
Quantity or quality? 
 
Quality or quantity? 
He taught the children 
Paid for the good, 
Society was enriched.
Quality or quantity?
 
Not passing, but flying,
No aphids, 
A shone,
I did not look, but ate, 
No trembling, 
And lived.
