Convinced that I know, there is no doubt
And the faith is as firm as ever.
But for some reason, the hand weakens insecurely —
She disarmed her conscience, made her weak.

Whom to listen to? Her
Or the crowd, 
What did you manage to collect?
For my senseless ideas 
Fools are ready to die.

So, I see two choices:
Self-liquidate 
Or lead the country to death.
How not to try
Do not try —
One way or another bend.
