Inevitably, the thought stretches
The word got confused in dreams
He does not strive for anything
Calm is like a crash.

Well, the fullness of comfort,
Didn't he go to her?
And challenges of a different kind
They offer a different catch.

In the parking lot or in neutral
You will not relax for a long time.
By inertia I will go to work â€”
Something will happen.
