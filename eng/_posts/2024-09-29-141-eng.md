Beautiful poems 
For someone,
A pun to someone. 
You will not please everyone. 
What I had to think about, 
What came like a storm, 
In an anxious awakening,
 
No teaching to the listeners 
And science itself. 
To have your own soul,
Hearing from the Spirit, 
The most understandable 
And passed on to the body.
So that someone else does not tease,
And she led her own.
