Muse Muse
Music, 
Queen of sounds, 
Cacophony of nature, 
Animals and people.
Solemnity of meetings
The longing of separation.
The grandeur of thunder 
And the creak of the door.

Tingling in the chest 
Adrenaline rushes,
Mugs on weekdays
It roars on the blue.

A piece of the universe,
Neutron language,
And without Adam babble 
Demiurga Word.
