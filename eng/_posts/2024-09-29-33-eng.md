It's time to move the capital 
Because Kiev has suddenly disappeared somewhere.
Ukrainian is not good for him —
Now the tongue reigns here.

Vinnytsia, Khmelnitsky rejoice — 
Narrowed the country's tongue
Ukraine will be taken over.
Because a rapist came to Kiev.

Kiev Moscow Province —
They tried a rocket and a bayonet.
Stepping to Lviv from Azovsk
Ukrainian Russian language.
