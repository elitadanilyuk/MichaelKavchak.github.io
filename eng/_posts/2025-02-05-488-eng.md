Mirages are lined with real roads,
Dreams call to bring the universe to life.
At first glance, there is a lack of ability
Suddenly, civilization is at a crossroads.

I haven't thought yet, but someone has already done
Imagination also competes.
Others passed where you did not go
Bio-anthill rumbles and rumbles.

Someone drowned, someone tramples himself,
What is the voodoo, they did not say until the end.
Road to new mirages!
For the establishment of full Glory.
