From vessel to vessel 
Through the funnel of the funnel,
From calm to calm 
Through the maelstrom of life.
Awarded from above
From narrow or wide 
The diameter of the neck —
Nabakh or step by step
Planning a merger.

From the tank to the barrel,
From the barrel to the bucket,
And there in the bank, 
In graphene and in the bottle —
Looked, sighed,
Filtered, flowed.
It was free somewhere,
And somewhere a stretch. 

Finally in the glass, and from it the throat,
From the inside of the body through the kidneys to the pores...
The overflows of life only change shape,
To go back to the tank 
Pumped the motor.
