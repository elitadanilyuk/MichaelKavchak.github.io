And in Russia again “rebellion”,
Because there are too many funerals
The graves are laid in fresh soil.
The war is fought by the dictator. 

People are outraged — a “password”!
Intending to kill,
They are weakened by terror.
They want to die more.

They are too small people “padyozh”,
The leader has to shout:
“Where do you join the country? 
Where to collect the forest for the graves?”
