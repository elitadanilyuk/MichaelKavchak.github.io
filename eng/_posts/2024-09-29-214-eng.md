Constancy brings
Healthy fruits.
Ragged
It's hard to concentrate â€”
Seduces emotions
Treacherous tension. 
He asks for rest
Or time is not enough
Because it trembles and waits
Near misfortune.

You and the circumstances
Where is the harmony?
How to achieve it?
The laws are right
Not ignored,
Respected from childhood
And in old age, bricked
Gather
And they learn to distribute.

Excessively stretched
Tears,
Softened in the chest
Braided. 
Well maintained
It will respond well 
Awarded 
And thanks 
Just inspired.
