They are looking for treasure and gold,
Happiness, glory — that's it! 
But the hammers of sin do not notice, 
His cunning.

Sufficiently choosing mom*,
Having driven away God and morality, 
Do we really go home,
Can we hold the Grail? **

Wish for money and wealth,
Health, happiness and goodness,
And take care of the sanctity,
So that the soul does not die.

* mamona — profit 
The Grail is the sacred golden bowl in which the blood of the Savior flowed from the cross was kept.
