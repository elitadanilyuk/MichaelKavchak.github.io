Like an ant blowing on the planet
And it rotated around the axis —
That's how it was hard to say to the poet,
To immediately clap everyone.

Consequence and cause 
Places can not be changed.
There is an order, a primeval pattern.
La società forma la gente
Under God she, though she is godless
Regardless of whether the law is respected or moved.

Stretching to the sky to rule the world, 
He tramples the earth like its owner. 
Our parents, or do we care for them? 
Is fire more important, or fire extinguisher?
