There is no poem today
From the sad news emptiness. 
The soul was saddened by the nightmare 
And cheerfulness is completely inappropriate.

From Kiev, the ears are sad,
Parallel day of mourning. 
And what other war,
How is it not tragic, to broaden the aura?

I give up optimism
At least now â€”
Curse to Putinism!
Condolences to Ukraine.
