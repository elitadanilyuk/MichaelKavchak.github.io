For a field of chamomile, a butterfly is not a miracle.
Nature itself is in harmony. 
Here is liquid soap â€”
Balls playful 
The air inflates.

Color overflows
Consolate all around.
In less than minutes
They will live above the field.

Both chamomile and butterfly 
Serve the Happy
For moments of fun 
In a short miracle.
