Why does it hurt so much
Change others?
Why their bolts
Do not arrange 
In my niche?
 
Why their carving 
Not the same,
Although it suits everyone. 
This is my trumpet,
They say it hurts.
 
Crumpled and gnarled
Torn and leaky.
No one is interested,
I would have to change...
 
... Yes, she is unbeatable.
Perfect for me.
