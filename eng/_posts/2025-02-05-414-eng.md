Once you start, you won't stop â€”
The format will change.
You will not close in yourself
Without achievements and losses.

Opposites are in unity.
Acknowledge and believe.
From zero to infinity, 
From the spark to the visions.

According to the application, another application,
At the end, there will be a continuation too.
Deep in the embryo sits the beginning
And the space for growth has no boundaries.
