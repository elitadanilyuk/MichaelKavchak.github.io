Trouble took away, satisfied grief.
Someone felt sorry and immediately forgot.
Captivates the sea with waves of troubles â€”
Brings new challenges
To feel consolation.

The next morning I woke up and you were breathing.
Someone's completed path, and you still have to go.
You draw and write out the underdrawn.
The first-leg waves will erase, you achieve the goal.

Meaning and purpose 
Pushing from the inside
You don't know the plan from above.
You remain driven by magnetic forces.
In the hope that with the lost 
Waiting for a date
If you don't want to, run and crawl.
