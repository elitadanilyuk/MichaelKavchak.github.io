Poets like manure.
Everyone has a file about himself.
You can see every weapon
She is not serious or hurts.

I was worried about the author, so he wrote,
The reader does not care, but he is a volcano.
From the depths of the subconscious, he learned,
How to achieve while avoiding wounds.

Opera is less reportable.
To praise or condemn is not the point
And whether he managed to become a man,
To return home exhausted.
