Good and evil
On the face of the Earth
Grand achievements and small deeds.

Around the Sun and in Galactic Orbits
In different scales of different fame,
Where the MegaUniverse is a worthless piece,
Where the bacterium does not imagine
The boundaries of the stadium.
Hates, loves,
Hurry home.

Where in atoms with electrons 
Measures of time â€”
According to their laws
I go to class,
To understand the environment and the middle,
In harmony with them for Glory to burn.
