If you wake up in the middle of the night,
So it's really important. 
Words will be selected 
Dig in 
Under the impossible.

Chaotic yesterday's worries,
Cleaned by sleep from sludge,
Pushed to work again
They resurrect the idea of the past.

Yesterday will continue tomorrow
More focused and stronger.
And the reason is an improved mantra,
Felled by the word more alive.
