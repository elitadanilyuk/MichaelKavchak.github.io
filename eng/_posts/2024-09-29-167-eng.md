Silently
You think hard.
Rest
Voice Connections.
Conscience of your own 
You cleanse,
You try
Avoid the trap.
 
The Word has come,
The body came to life
Rioted. Spoke.
Not just to share
With close friends —
In his own speech
Enriched myself.
 
Do not waste energy
To the wasteland.

Before I say,
All right, weigh it,
Not to ask:
“Did I want to,
To stay asleep
The mouth of my guards?”
