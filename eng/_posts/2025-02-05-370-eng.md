Autumn is coming, and with it sores —
At least write yourself down in the weaklings.
The common cold should be looked at differently —
Nature reminds of fists.

Comfort relaxes
Fight to live. 
Problems and runny nose mobilize
Awaken the will to create powerfully.
Sometimes they don't feel sorry for us at all.

The potential should not be destroyed,
Search for reserves and conscience
They don't stop us moving
To bring evil or good.
