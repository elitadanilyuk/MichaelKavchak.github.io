Premonition
It is not necessary to come true. 
Sometimes in words
It is allowed to make mistakes.
 
Searching for truth —
Go through the options. 
With pure intentions —
In Shit Diamonds.
 
You get caught up in mistakes
And you will discover the truth.
And you are not afraid of her 
For lifesaving advice.
