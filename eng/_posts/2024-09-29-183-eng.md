Steel on the veranda
Observe
The world is collapsing.
As a team,
They will begin to destroy
You and us.
 
Interesting show,
We've been waiting a long time
Even if they could,
Removed.
And finally again
They got the war.
 
Is it the last one?
Asks for adrenaline.
This is the question
Many generations.
