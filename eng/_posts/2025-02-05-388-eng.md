There is nothing but energy.
The illusion of gas, liquid and solid.
To magnetic forces, we say “matter”,
With the release of the lung,
Attracting the heavy.

Not Just Hands, Feet, and Bodies
Approaching or moving away.
Deeds, words and thoughts
We hate or love.

The Creator said, and it happened. 
From the spiritual Word was incarnated. 
From the explosion took off,
It was compacted in fragments.
