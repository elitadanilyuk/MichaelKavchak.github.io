Ukraine, cucumber seed
They stomp for ages, 
Exterminate the genus,
And he is cucumbers 
According to tribal laws
In different directions relentlessly 
Fills the world.

They take her into captivity, 
Running from grief is a fugitive,
Under the occupiers, she was used to pain, 
Independence is defended with a shield and a sword. 

So now replenishments are waiting
Argentina, Canada and Taiwan.
The Russians are waiting. 
Even if they kill her.
Contrary to her efforts.
