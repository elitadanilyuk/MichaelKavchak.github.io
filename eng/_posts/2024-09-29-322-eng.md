How did they help and who sought,
Let's count then 
But it's better not to count. 
David the population rewrote
And he became guilty.

Statistics lie, just like every person
Even sincerely looking for the truth.
Because certain consequences are preceded by a cause,
Sometimes he confessed, but he would rather keep quiet.

You will not be responsible for others 
Only for yourself. 
What do you choose 
Evaluate without error 
The sky.
