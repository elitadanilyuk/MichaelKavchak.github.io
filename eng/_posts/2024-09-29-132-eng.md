— You have horns, hooves and tail, — 
The opponent interrupted the conversation.
You are torn by anger
They took the opportunity to explain.
 
Even horns, hooves or tails
Did not notice behind me
It's not easy now —
They won't be friends with you anymore.
 
You were “bitten”
Exposed “Satan”
Rumors have been debunked 
They believed the liar.
