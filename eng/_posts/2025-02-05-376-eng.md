“I will teach through urine,” 
It came to mind Wild.
I see now and I'm silent —
On breaking consciousness and sleep
Sparks of truth catch the song,
In order not to forget, I write quickly.

I do not postpone until the morning 
Tips for the queen of the night.
Add to archive bank
Prophetic hints and slogans.

Like just woke up to the toilet,
Remembered and wrote
According to the plot.
To remember the source of knowledge 
He testified to others.
