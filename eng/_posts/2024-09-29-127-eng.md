Is a murderer a murderer a murderer?
If only in a word 
I could stop
When under threat of destruction.
I would have convinced 
And no one would have eaten.
 
I've been there again and again.
Together with the neighbors, the whole village.
What to do, pity God,
Is it bad to skip without hindrance?
 
The evil will stop there
Where to stop him
Where to kill and steal 
They will not give it to him.
She didn't give in to words,
You have to twist your hands
Put in jail.
He will continue to kill â€” 
The mad man will be killed.
