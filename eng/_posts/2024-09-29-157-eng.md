In every nation â€” 
People and people.
Any adventure 
Become easy and close.
 
Let the scoundrel not be upset
Give me a good hand,
Immediately spit out the poison
Understand, sympathize and say goodbye.
 
Then you will be counted
A human, not a dog,
Evaluate and advertise
Ukraine is good
Representative.
