I am a little man,
But I long for the big,
To live in Ukraine
Without the “brother” of the wild.

With his “tongue” 
And the mania of “vilicia”,
With Fuehrer Puyl —
Hoopnik without “prilicia”.

For a moment, I am convinced —
Remove the barriers.
I can't handle it myself
But there are millions of us.
