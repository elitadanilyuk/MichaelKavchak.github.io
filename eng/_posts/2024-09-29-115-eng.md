The West builds, 
The East is destroying.
For example, Kyiv
Lays Moscow.
The Kremlin is surrounded by walls
And then he has
Mercy begs
From him brings to himself
Trouble with your own hands.
 
The predator died in the background,
Enriched sacrifice — it's time.
Toilets-refrigerators 
Glad.
Blood is drunk in Moscow with a “cheer”.
 
Multiple estates,
Children are born.
You think, you do good, 
And in the end you find 
What do you bring? 
For myself and for others — 
Suffering and evil.
