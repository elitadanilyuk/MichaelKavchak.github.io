Worthy to meet the born in the world
And to spend worthily —
Everyone's responsibility 
E la società
To carry the spark of life together,
Do not extinguish God's work.

Yours, brother, flash
And the fireworks of the sister
In stellar glory
They see the worlds.

In vain do you miss
About their own worthlessness. 
Believe and feel 
In eternity, certainty.
