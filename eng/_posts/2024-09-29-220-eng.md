Serves the routine
Confident
Fullness of Life
With a clear plan.

Searching for meaning 
of their existence,
Or not —
The time will come
It will open to everyone: 
We fussed
For his order,
We gurgled 
In his pot.)

In pursuit of progress
Its existence
Benefits of achievement,
Or not
In peace or in war —

The time will come
For all of us,
It will open to all,
Even the blind: 
We fussed
Out of reach 
Fought
For His Order
His books 
In remembrance,

We were bursting, 
Pushed 
With balls
In His Pot
Travellers 
Arrivals.)
