They were not liberated, but occupied.
Calling the territory its own.
The population was destroyed and deported —
They took possession of the land. 

Remains to erase the memory.
They say it was always theirs.

To silence historical experts, 
In the nick of time, imperial haste
Ruthlessly destroying culture —
To not remember the enslaved again
I will give birth to my nature.
And most importantly, forget the language.
