It is necessary to confess,
Repentance of conscience
Do not delay.
Trash to throw away 
And valuable to keep
And Rearrange.

Reimburse losses 
And we have to apologize.
... and you ask yourself suddenly,
And what to confess?

It's really easy to confess,
Hardly necessary,
When there is paradise in the soul, 
Not hell,
And around 
Gold and silver.
