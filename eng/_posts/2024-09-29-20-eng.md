We are not at war with you
Others are taken into custody. 
They are sent to battle
They have a real service.

We hide from the military comma,
Or maybe they came to the reception â€”
They tell the young to die
Become stronger in the gap.

Inexperienced, but mobile
The best on the front line.
Front to rear is also important
As it is not yours or theirs, it is mine.
