Weigh in the evening and in the morning.
The weight of the soul is the difference.
In you, in her chosen one,
She does not sit still.

When you sleep,
It remains your body.
It flies somewhere, and you lie,
For the body to rest.

With you close to her,
Infinity is her element.
Fulfill the mission of the dead,
To return to eternity is her dream.
