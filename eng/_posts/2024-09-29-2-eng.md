Mikhail Arkhangel
Now in Ukraine,
9 months ago.
He is in the east and in the south
Putin's hordes are driving.

I will not say that he is charming,
And Zaluzhny's boss.
Makes the Ukrainian brave,
And the Horde plan is a failure.

Zhora-Heorhii
Flares,
Michael waves his sword.
Palagia is BURNING.
They fight with heavenly fire.
