Different in the West
Or genocides in the east 
Determine the boundaries of peoples. 
North and south, the climate is restrained. 
Natural boundaries are mountains and water.
And as the prey of the Light, 
And they are incentives. 

We argue with you 
Where are yours where ours
In view of history, 
While the patience of the bowl
Claims are filling.

Pollier over the top â€” 
Here she is.
Not yesterday, now
A new war.
