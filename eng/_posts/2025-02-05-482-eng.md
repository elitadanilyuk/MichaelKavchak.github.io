They love for their beauty, attention, tenderness,
Paper brought us closer to you.
Then came care and loyalty, 
And first there was a test and a written essay. 

A beautiful soul hid the gaze, 
She was ashamed of the words, she was silent. 
It was not by chance that we were close â€”
I read your soul on the sheet.

Do not look in my direction, do not say anything,
I know, you are mine, between us a magnet.
Neither you nor I need anyone,
The world is filled with you and me.
