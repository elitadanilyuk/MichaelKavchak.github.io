That's when the alarm goes off,
The door will open in a day, 
I look forward to strong motivations.
For the birth of new songs. 

Without a morning spark of meaning 
Some activity will be recorded.
And the heavens are visible to the agency —
The soul in the parking lot will remain.

Avoid dry inertia
Asks for an everyday boundary.
In order to make progress — 
Where is the body, there is spirit and soul.
