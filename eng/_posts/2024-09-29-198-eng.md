Lonely complains
The married man complains. 
Discontent 
There will always be. 
What we have, we do not notice. 
Gathered by an upside-down,
We yearn for the missing.
 
Complain about the lack — 
Give in to emptiness 
For the best of luck, 
Like the wind, chase. 
 
And the treasures - here they are,
In the crowd and in solitude —
Just recognize it.
What do you have is the prices
Come back and take it.
Don't even look —
Rejoice and have it.
