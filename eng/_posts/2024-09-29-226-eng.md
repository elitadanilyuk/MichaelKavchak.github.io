Why CaliGula?
I just liked it,
And Lucifer â€”
Sounds even better...
What shall we name,
We like them,
Fate by letting go 
In vain.

As long as it doesn't pop up,
Or ask
Child's Name.
Desperate 
All of a sudden I'll get
And you will repent
Conscience is late.

Pleasant to hear
And the meaning is good
And the evil spirit in him,
Invoked karma.
