Anxiety requires a solution.
Remain a stayer
It does not always work out. 
Readiness for two is already mulched,
He will jump on three and grab.

He will cling to salvation
Teeth and claws,
Momentarily object
Adequacy of truth.

And suddenly realizing,
What managed to survive,
You admit to being stunned
Inability to comprehend...


... How did it happen?
