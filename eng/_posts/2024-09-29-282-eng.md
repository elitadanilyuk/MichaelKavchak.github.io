In your heart pocket
Your code, 
Your key to understanding the world.
Overcoming obstacles 
And the challenges are daily
They give you an education.

Like a flashlight,
It only serves you best. 
Let it not upset you and not overshadow you 
Claming about your loss. 

Everyone has their own flashlight 
And its own unique way,
In the labyrinths their spurs,
And yours â€” 
In your heart and in your hands.
