Grandma's love —
Joy through the crown. 
Born to lay the bases,
Bliss-conscious old age.

The circle closes in the grandchildren
Happy completion of the mission.
Not too late and not ahead of time
No overkill and no collision.

For completeness bow to fate,
For a reliable kind of grounding.
She was pleased with her grandchildren — quite a bit
Because great-grandchildren are already a prize.
