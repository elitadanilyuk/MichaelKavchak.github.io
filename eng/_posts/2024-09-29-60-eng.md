Is time a line or a circle?
How to count our days? 
The snowflake melts, you hear the word, 
They are the same and no longer the same.

The war is over, I thought.
I said that I will not forgive nits,
Because so much rage was gathering, 
And here I go to meet her.

Ready to lend a hand
And again through the cycle of all beginnings
The reincarnation of oblivion
I introduce into the channel.
