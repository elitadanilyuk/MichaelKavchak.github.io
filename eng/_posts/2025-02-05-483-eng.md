He who has cared for us from time immemorial,
Gives to parents and gives teachers 
What a love without limits and without medicine
I wanted to grow a big one from scratch. 

Called from nothing, taught to speak,
From the cradle and the school into the society he gathered,
Through death translates to real life,
So that the one who killed,
He had no more rights. 

Watering and feeding at lower levels,
Uses circumstances for intermediaries. 
Calling home is no longer for families 
And in the family of descendants and predecessors.
