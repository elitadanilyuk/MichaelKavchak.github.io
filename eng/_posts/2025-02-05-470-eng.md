A year passes of collaboration with poetry,
Please summarize. 
He combined it with the family, with the profession,
To open wider eyes to the world. 

Above all, to myself, 
Asking to Heaven.
He can see me too.
I don't want to walk in the dark, 
First you need to help yourself,
Do not teach your neighbor in a simple way.

Thank you, Teacher, for the treasures.
On this day Christmas especially.
So great is the water in the future.
Your love is an unsurpassed miracle.
