Distant friendship steals from neighbors.
You hand your soul to a stranger with a pseudonym.
Confession without consequences is annoying
Melted in the distance with a hazy memory.

Strangers — fable and history
To my family — a scar and a provocation.
No better — outside theory
And inside — a valuable share?

Little is worn 
Others around,
And I have enough
Keyword.
