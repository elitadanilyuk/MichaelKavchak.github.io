A lot of artistic paint —
Filled museums
Drawn with a tear — 
In the heavenly archive. 
From the battlefield 
Collecting trophies
Disregard 
To orphans and widows. 

Crippled 
They do not notice 
To forget the trouble.
ANGELS
Tears are collected —
Inform the Judge.

The verdict is returned 
Boomerang. 
Teardrop refers
To the aggressor.
Revenge with napalm.
