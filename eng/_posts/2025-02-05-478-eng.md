There were no such days yesterday,
Tomorrow, they are rubbish.
Only what conscience felt today
That's what real life is called.

Plans for the future and regret for the past 
They steal the current one.
If you have a square, do not miss the round, 
There is no bag, the pigeon feeds. 

At this point, your gratitude decides:
You stick to the track or go down the slope
What hinders, and what hastens, 
Gives abundance or leads to tears.
