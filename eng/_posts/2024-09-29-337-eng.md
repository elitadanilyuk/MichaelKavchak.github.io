Trouble will not come without an invitation
Every consequence is preceded by a cause.
Sow first
Then cutting,
And gives birth to wheat or clover.

Bur'ian will not grow in the field 
And the roof will not leak
There will be no dampness in the basement
When you work the shoulder.

The enemy will not attack 
The thief does not dig
Trouble will not come 
When taken care of,
