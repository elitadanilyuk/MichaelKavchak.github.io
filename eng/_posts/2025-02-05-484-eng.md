Friendship is cracking 
Suspicion of images draws pictures. 
From pity to yourself, the soul hurts —
Looks outwards, looks for reasons. 

At hand is the nearest one who shared the bread, 
Not so mealy as hearty —
Why was he silent or not saying that?
Who is to blame? He is the first.

Satisfied enemy, empathizing, listens,
Rejoice — the enemy is weakened.
Over time, the companion from the web will confuse,
And a distraught slave will go free.
