I found where you can nail yourself to the sky.
My desire is very much needed here.
No one will occupy that place. 
Either me or no one is holding on to him.

Face to the ground, 
With your back to the dome,
To remember and know about the world given,
To hear the soul that sighed upward and gasped,
To pour into it and become it.
 
I'm still down. 
And the niche is waiting.
I go to her,
Although the flesh does not let go.
