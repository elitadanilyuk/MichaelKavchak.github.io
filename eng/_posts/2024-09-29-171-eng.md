Observant
He perceives signs. 
He and outside 
He serves them. 
The dates of birth reads,
The decisive sign awaits 
To declare your own.
 
From signs, the world is molded, 
In weather and in surnames, 
In thoughts and in words.
Disputed and fixated,
Combed and frayed —
In signs and joy,
In signs and fear.
 
You don't know 
And you don't suspect
What will you come back like 
Will you come back like this —
Again and again 
About yourself you repeat:
Your real name is
Sign.
