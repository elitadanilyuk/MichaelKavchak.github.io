Voiceover of youth 
So far away
With scaling
Sensitivity
Not completely erased.

From the very core,
From the center of the interior
To the surface is requested.
She barely touches
And back to the core
Rapidly applies.

In the very first cell
of your being,
In the root cause...
Because everything will die
And she is alive.
