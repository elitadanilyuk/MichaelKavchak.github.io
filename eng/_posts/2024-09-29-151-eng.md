Under the ice of sleep 
Neophilite*
Wake up and not going. 
I sleep,
A quiet bandit 
Cliche 
And then he hides.
 
Tickling 
Subconscious truth, 
Progavish —
Shadow property.
Zahochesh
Catch the unthinkable —
Submit your phone —
Something will fall into it.
 
Fishing 
The float will not release 
Attention — 
Fishermen are. 
Cheat trowel 
Grinds and cleans.
And proclaim fervently —
In a dream came! 
____________
*Neophilitis (still not used word) — capable of filling in a new way.
