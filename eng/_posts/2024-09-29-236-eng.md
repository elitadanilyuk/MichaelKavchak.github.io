Emptiness carries rest
From what deviation.
Usually comes
Or selected.
Depressing in stagnation
Without changes man,
Thoughts and joints
Without movement, they dry up.

Rusting knife
Forgotten for a long time
And Zacherstviye bread â€”
Consume it already.
Expect alarm in idleness.
Movement saves the soul and body.

The spirit cares about movement.
He steps in and pulls back.
Vital tone 
Holds securely
In the construction of bridges 
And the barricade.
