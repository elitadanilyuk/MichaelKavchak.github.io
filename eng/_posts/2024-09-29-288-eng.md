The string is taut.
Would play. 
Unfortunately, the melody is not the same.
In the battle of a broken guitar 
They won't hear anymore. 
The height is also broken with it.

The string is taut. 
Would sing. 
But instead of a song, moan-rage.
String stretched 
Would break,
But guitars do not carry. 

There are no hands
Because it is not well-groomed
On a minefield at night.
Screaming-silent string stretched, 
Soul string.
