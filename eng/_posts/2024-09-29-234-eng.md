Buddhist pacifist
Raise a rebellion.
Bloodthirsty crowd
Gathered on the Maidan,
Outraged by the call
To repentance 
Dictatorship of the Exhausted
Fellow citizens.

“On his fork!
We need revenge!
What is the rest of the world?
The dictator is gone!”
“Peaceful cooperation 
With usurpator false, 
If not freedom,
It is better to die.”

What is tranquility
It's hard to remember,
Victory is networked,
Victory mirage.
Asks the monk
“Stop killing!”,
Inspires in the people
Courage to violence.
