City Center,
Old house
Squeaky floor
Benches without backs.
 
On a shaky table 
Antique vases.
Paper trash
Like in a bookstore.
 
With ties or butterflies 
In elegant suits,
Beautifully tailored
Waiting for customers.
Cash,
In the conflicts of savory...
 
@ 
Active youth
Cheerful families
They mate and give birth
Happy and free. 
 
Friends in the park
The pizza is ready. 
Stadium outside the city,
The form of a football player.
 
He went on the offensive 
My son-in-law Yura.
He is a lawyer...
 
And in the center â€” 
Advocacy.
