You collect treasures for yourself — 
They will find out and follow them. 
Satisfying someone's needs —
Grateful ones will carry it on their hands. 
 
Fate itself determines 
What you collect and what you distribute. 
You save when you have enough.
You ask, then you give. 
 
When the market is crowded
And no one needs anything
So the rest has come.
You can stay home.
