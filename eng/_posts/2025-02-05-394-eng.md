Knowledge is enriching if you believe it.
To doubt them is harmful.
As convincing, they will be forced to act —
Wait for the reward.

What is true and what is false?
Resolves conscience.
Not dollars, not hryvnias,
And the truth of service —
Everyone should die
And to achieve salvation. 

I'm not trying to prove 
Neither to opponents, nor to themselves,
I tend not to touch someone else,
And actually recognize.
Find your own ways.
