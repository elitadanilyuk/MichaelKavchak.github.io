With the hope that they will not forget,
Monuments are built during life 
At least in the family, if not everywhere,
To outsmart time pendulums.

Leave a deep mark 
And a valuable relay 
Father and grandfather sought.
It also belongs to the son of the poet.

They grow in riches
Not the only bread 
Or golden palaces,
But in a word incorruptible.
