Asshole 
He got along with the fools.
Not so, 
Like normal people.
The challenges in it were exciting. 
Let's see what happens. 
 
The high priests are decapitated,
They are thrown into the trash,
Modest and unconquered 
They are guilty of burlap.
 
In camel clothes
Provoke cackle
Calling those who are not indifferent
Shoot the Messiah.
