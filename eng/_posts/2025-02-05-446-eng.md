Where you went, you have to go back there.
Wherever you invested, you will take it from there.
Not always immediately, sometimes long wait,
But you can't bypass justice.

Sow the good — the influx of loaves,
Misfortune on the head is for the former evil.
Disregard for dad and mom 
It will turn the offspring into a snakehive.

Boomerang and karma are foreign words.
Return and return are easy to understand.
Tomorrow the poor will get rich.
Don't worry — the stork will fly.
