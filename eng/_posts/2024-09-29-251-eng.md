Called wise.
Not just praised. 
Announced 
Responsible for the truth. 
Hold on to it with all your might
Front, sides and back.

Bathe in glory 
You have no right â€”
She's not yours. 
Poisonous 
Stolen glory 
The name Thief is its carrier.

You're just a carrier, 
Transmissions participant.
And the eye of God
He's watching you.
The word really 
Wisdom owner.
And glory belongs to Him.
