A look under your feet, and THOUGHTS at the top.
Concerned world, 
And there is a bubble in it. 
These are my thoughts about Diana,
Everyone has bags, and she has a handbag.

Curiosity and curiosity
Full sinus of dreams
And with them even
Also the name of Ry.

A swarm of desires and aspirations 
Hopes and hopes.
So I wish for achievements,
Diano Rey.
