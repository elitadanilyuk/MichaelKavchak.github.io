It is a sin to be constantly reminded of war
It is a sin to completely forget about it.
Sin is to flee, to abandon and to betray,
The sin is to stay, not to hear the warnings.

It is a sin to wait in a hopeless place
Sin is to run headlong into the flame,
Sin is desertion in haste
Do not escape to the bomb shelter, burn in the apartment.

There is sin in everything, and what is holiness? ...
... Remind and forget
Hold and leave.
It would be lucky to orientate
To listen or to ignore.
Let childhood guess, old age will not stumble
Hide or run away.
When to sink and where to burn 
Sure to know.
There is no mistaking the sky between the stands.
