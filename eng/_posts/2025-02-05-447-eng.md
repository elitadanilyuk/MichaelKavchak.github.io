“Vasser” falls from the sky,
From “aqua” and “aqua” the world is created.
“Water” and “hydro” guides and exercises,
“Vater” is circling
As in the word “hello”.

“Madam” fastens, 
“Early” runs
“Hooray” is
“Vero” rumbles.

We drink it, we water it. 
Everywhere with her, where we don't go.
Without it we have nothing —
We live by it.
