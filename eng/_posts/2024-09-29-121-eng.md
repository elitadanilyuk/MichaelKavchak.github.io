He built a beautiful house,
Treated patients,
The Armed Forces gave a million,
He fed the homeless.
 
Pilot, doctor, pianist, 
Locksmith, nanny, journalist, 
Drawing is a little talent 
She was a real optimist. 
 
Death has taken away, let him take, 
Let the body rest. 
But their business lives, 
Getting closer to paradise.
