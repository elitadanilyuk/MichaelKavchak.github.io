Dirty water, 
Filtered by soils 
Healing beats the source.
Noises-words,
Chewed by thoughts
Consciousness becomes a wing. 

First you understand the word “mom”,
Holding on to her, with her milk.
Parental Karma Shapes You
Not just food and protected sleep. 

You hear and learn to think,
Add values to chains.
How to clean the water
So is the right vision.
