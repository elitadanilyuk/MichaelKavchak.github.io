How does Abel live?
All life collects 
Before death 
JokeThe joke will ignite 
With God's pleasure,
Dies. 

Cain goes crazy: 
“Extinguish, extinguish!”
He is looking for his brother,
And he's already dead. 
There is no brother. 

The altar is broken,
The fire was extinguished.
I want to live in eternity,
Not among the dead.
