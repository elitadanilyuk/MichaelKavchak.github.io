Repentance seen
Everyone has his own.
Someone turns around, cries,
Someone spits on the sanctity.

He came to confession and boasted,
They thought the sinner was actually a hero. 
He scoffs at the truth, he sneers at the good,
He looks like a sober drunk cowboy.

Even though my neighbor blesses,
In search of death,
May the Almighty help
Remove My 
And my wipe.
