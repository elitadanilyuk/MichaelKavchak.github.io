Thunderstorms — 
Necessity for rainbows.
Tears 
Happiness carries an armful. 
 
Just to look at it properly,
To notice the positive.
B conclusions not to be mistaken, 
And the benefits to collect.
 
Sad you will always find
They are not looking for him.
But whether you will accept it well —
They ask in court.
