There are two poles in the competition:
Best 
And the worst. 
Manifestation of beauty 
Or lost.
In pictures or in verse.
 
In the middle of the attempt
From primitive
Break away.
It is wrong to be offended
Weak to strong.
It would equate to him.
 
Then we grow,
When we guess,
Not from envy
We crush and tear.
