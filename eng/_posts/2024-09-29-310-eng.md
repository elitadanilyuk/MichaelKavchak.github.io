There are a lot of runners,
One wins,
Who strives eagerly 
And the track to which contributes.
Who chooses the right path
From the shaft receives tire torsion,

Who is lucky
And the goal is clear.
This will run,
With him strength.

Tear to the finish
To crack the skin.
In fact, the hero is not you
And your faith.
