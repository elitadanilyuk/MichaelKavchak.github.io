Jealous crocodile teeth and a wide throat,
Why hurry to get to them?
To find the strength to stand proudly â€”
Save yourself and set an example.

Osanka flat, face raised,
With an accurate word and a clean look.
Do not surrender yourself and be bent by fate
Help the weak and sagging.

Paralyzed feelings
In love, in finance, in work,
Healthy surrounded by thoughts, 
Indicate the exit of the soul and flesh.
