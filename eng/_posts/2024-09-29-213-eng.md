If it weren't for a new day,
If it were not for the resurrection, 
It would diminish the song,
Hope for salvation. 

If Christ had not died, 
So that death 
Overcome 
What would we live with now?
About what 
Would there be worries?

They would be afraid of the end
What is null 
It all adds up,
They wouldn't know the future 
What passes into eternity.
