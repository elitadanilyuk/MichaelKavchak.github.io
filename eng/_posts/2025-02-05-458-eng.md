The old one plucks his own feathers,
To insulate and strengthen the nest,
I change my name on the nickname,
He distributes himself so that the bird lives.

Imagine the lipstick on the beak,
Polished claws, painted crest â€”
Cleanliness is pleasant to the people
But behind were virginity and marriage.

Self-preservation has established itself
It took a lot of years
Eggs laid, children were born,
And now we have to continue the genus.
