Helping hard,
One day
The tongue is loopy.
They will find the culprit â€”
Exhausted horse,
And do not beg for mercy.

Shoot
The skin will be torn
They are allowed on the meat.
They will devour
And then they will go,
Others will be found,
They will force you to pull.

Pull, for this is the fate
Because you have to pull
Thinking about the tongue,
Without bulging 
Alpha male
From yourself.
