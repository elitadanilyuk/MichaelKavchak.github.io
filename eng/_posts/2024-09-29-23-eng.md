We have not been taught human language 
So can he teach the tongue?
Let the chaff feed 
From screens, speakers and books.

Speech will become unnecessary 
Let's talk with the tongue.
The power of the Russian word
Prague and London are welcome!

Let's forget all Ukrainian 
Let's renounce our parents.
Replenish the Orc army.
To kill brothers for a language.
