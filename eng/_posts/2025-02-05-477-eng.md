The word goes beyond the meaning
It is looking for another,
New or what is lost,
There is more meaning in the team.

From nothing covers everything,
Ether is still too empty
Unusual concepts carries
The idea of comfort is disturbing.

Perfection strives, tears through the thickets,
The rear suspension moves forcefully.
You have to fall under the ice rink of evolution â€”
So defined.
