Question mark instead of a dot
Is the coma missed,
Like a river without masonry,
On the way home.

As if walking in a straight line
Blowing a passing wind â€”
And here, on the shore, stand
Because of the comma, or the colon between the letters.

Because of a small mistake
Misunderstood,
Made a pause
Separation mark.
