Say what you think, and you are a prophet
Light to neighbor and clarity for yourself.
In the right direction, the step is directed
Clear past, future and present.

They are waiting for praise even for the wrong,
The better the pimp, the higher the salary.
The undershirt will be envied - no wonder.
Affirm the offender and the suppostor.

The truth is painful for the sinner
Unpleasant to the ear and to the eye.
So on the hint of a mocker's compassion
The stone flies to the prophet.
