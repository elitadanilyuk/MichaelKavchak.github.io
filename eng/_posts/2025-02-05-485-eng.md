While the cans were filled with milk, 
The needy took and said, 
That you are good.
Suddenly you stopped eating.
You bring had
Big money.
Not to the end, it turned out, ready.
Shame on the cow!

Yesterday's best become the worst
To their bazaar or to meat!
They are replaced by cunning others —
The appetites of the voracious go out of scale at times.

There are no complaints to the indifferent,
It is useless to wait for gifts from them,
Even murderers are forgiven in a sense —
Who used to give
And he stopped, 
The guilty one.

(The wife said, “This is life.”)
