If I believe in my mother, especially in the ninth month,
And my appearance is waiting outside,
Tension grows in each bone 
Do not explain â€”
Feelings are indescribable.

And what to call consciousness, 
How are there no words?
Alone with the unknown
There is not even light.

Soon the water will flow
And the uterus will open.
To attain eternal life,
The born are afraid to die
I will be born into their world.
