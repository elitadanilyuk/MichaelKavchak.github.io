Philosopher-poet
He is not friends with wealth
The robber of it 
Will not steal.
From his sonnets 
Only indifference
To the riches of spitting,
He lives only in words. 

Immortality excites 
There is more of a thinker. 
Diamonds and gold 
He does not shine. 
He does not hear death 
The eternal has come together in him, 
Husty PokoTom
He will not accept.

The wealth of romance 
Not in hryvnias, not in euros. 
He languishes all the time 
How to save the soul. 
Pacific, Atlantic
They will dry for sure 
When they know how jealous
Reached the goal.
