Let's forget about her.
How much is it possible? Three years of war!
Let us return to the peace we so long for
As if it goes to spring, not to winter.

Why Depresse 
And to bring boredom to others?
Let's sing 
And dance,
Grief not to be noticed
Do not pay attention to pain and trouble.

I sing, I dance, I walk in the bars,
I am joking, because I am an optimist.
But I only meet tired judgments.
For indifference â€” hatred, anger and anger.
