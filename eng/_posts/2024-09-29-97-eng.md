You don't have time...
Where at that time 
Dial? 
Do you even know?
What are you spending on?
Which route I chose,
What to achieve?

Work... Work. 
And why? 
In worries 
MarNota, 
Glory to the GluPots,
In the trenches
To waste on the wind. 

Stop and think.
Save strength. 
How smart, 
Having driven away the doubt,
You will come to the grave.
