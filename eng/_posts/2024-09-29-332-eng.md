A boat of inspiration overcomes difficulties.
They languish on the shore without purpose or need.
Healthy hobbies are afraid of stupidity,
Interests come to life like nature in March.

We dream of living, we do not know how.
We are exhausted in searches. 
Not everyone will be able to master
Understand the desires right away.

Feel the meaning 
The most important call is 
For everyone is personal. 
To float the boat, 
And the ideas touch
He led into the eternal, into the holy and pure.
