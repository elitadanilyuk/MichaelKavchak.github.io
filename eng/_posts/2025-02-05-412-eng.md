Who is to blame that you are not like that?
School, parents or country?
Supposedly good, but suddenly evil,
Yesterday was violent, but now calm.

The magnets of circumstance can not always be explained
And from the side you can see even worse —
And here you run or lie down,
Someone is pleasant, and someone is disgusting.

What is the criterion, who will judge —
Scaffolding or pedestal?
Whoever sent, he will awaken
He took from you, and gave to you.
