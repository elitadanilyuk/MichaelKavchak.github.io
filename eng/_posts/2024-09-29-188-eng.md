Here it is, on the approach,
And you didn't know,
What is his name,
On what occasion
And what to expect.
 
Reached?
Where there.
Self
There was a knock on the door.
Do not believe
Projects — 
To someone
Barely scraped quietly,
Someone's feet were groping.
 
Open —
You'll see.
Pustysh —
GO IN.
Unhappily
Show hospitality —
Gifts will decompose.
Vocation! —
So let's say.
