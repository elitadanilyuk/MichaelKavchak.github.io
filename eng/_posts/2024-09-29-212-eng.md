Many peers
It was already dying. 
I live premium, 
Albeit on credit.
So I did not do much else,
The flight continues
Don't erase mine yet 
Meteorite.

Like every soul,
I want to leave,
Burn to the ground
But so enlighten,
To see the mountains
Cities and countries
And the radiance of my
Couldn't stop
No curtains
Curtains or walls.

Would not fall
The star of Lucifer,
To burn everything.
Not hail 
Not a whirlwind
And the sun as a ray
Drill the night,
Touching the tip,
At least resurrect someone.
