Knowledge 
Lead to the result. 
Good to goodness,
Angry to suffering.
In happiness and love 
It's easy to die
Even death â€”
It's a pleasure 
The cherished desires.

Hell in Eternity,
Horror on earth 
I sow hate.
On God's Scale 
At the bottom and at the height
Intrigue seekers
Getting rid of 
Confidence.

Convinced 
Righteous 
In the paths of the straight,
Treasures are not stolen.
And in God's.
