They said we had no precipitation,
I once believed it myself.
Without snow It was winter,
And in the summer 
Not hell without measure.

Something dripped
In autumn and spring,
But isn't it 
Call it rain?
Grief was not known
Without SUM and with SUM —
In rest and work
You live every day.

Convinced
Myself and around:
Life is not hell.
A given paradise.
What they wanted, they took,
Did not notice the pain...
After going far,
Got it with you:
In the shower or in the heat 
Cool or warm—
Seek refuge.
