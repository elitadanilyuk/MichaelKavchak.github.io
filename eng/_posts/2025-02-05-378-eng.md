Judas on the teacher
He tells the scribe —
How do you like this picture?
The saint helps the robber —
Surrenders to slaughter
Father and son.

Like, stronger 
There is no need to resist.
Is it worse?
Serve the sinner
Does God want you?

You will commit violence
Over their own people —
You will judge yourself, 
Not now, then later.
