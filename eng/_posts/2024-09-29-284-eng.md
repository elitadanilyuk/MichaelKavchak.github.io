Tired of happiness and tired of grief â€”
The change in speed in the transmission of evolution.
The grandeur of the atom and the narrowness of the sea
They lead to Maidan and revolution.

Claims to the world 
And dissatisfaction with yourself 
Break the closed
Stagnation barrier.

You can't do anything, such a plan.
Sometimes with the people, and sometimes alone
Sometimes you have to overcome extremes,
Some seek, and flee from others.
