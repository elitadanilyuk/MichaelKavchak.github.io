Transferred, 
What is called in the military. 
Orally.
I was reminded orally yesterday.
I seem to be a soldier again. 
Retired, but they did not ask about age. 

Confused. Relocated.
At work, to a new place.
Where to appear? I don't know, not sure.
What to collect? Will I change clothes, eat supplies? 

One thing is known
Stop the invasion not with a word, but with a deed
Missing me â€”
The body is needed.
