Tell yourself: horseradish,
Horns will crawl from all sides.
Voices: everything is great â€”
Then wait for happy changes. 

Safe Pleasure Center
From words of encouragement,
What will guard his fortress.
Do not let enemies in.

The stimulus from the outside will lose strength.
If the gate is locked. 
Weakly flapping wings
And the dragon will fly away.
