Sheep, sheep and ram —
It's like one family.
Submissive, stupid and tyrant —
And how is a different person?

Stupid and submissive is a simpleton.
Everyone is bad when they are evil.
Stubborn is a hero and a leader,
Great, if for good.

Everyone is afraid of God, 
For he sins, because conscience judges.
To reach such a level,
To love Him in return —
Humbly, stupidly or with a horn.
