Cap-kan. 
Betrayed.
After many years of faithfulness.
She doesn't know yet — I've already lost her...
I did not expect such meanness from myself.

The fog has conquered consciousness,
Attracted by a random beauty
Deception should not be covered with any words
And without the condemned I will not live.

The whole world is indifferent
Only she is the only 
He takes care of me.
Oh, how the heart is tearing and straining —
He will lose his soul
Beloved wife,
As if I'm disappointed.
