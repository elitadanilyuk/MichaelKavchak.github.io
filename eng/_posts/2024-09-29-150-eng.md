Matches are USEFUL 
Burn in turn 
And not the whole pack at once. 
Conscientiously —
Not always against wool
Tease the dog. 
 
Desperate 
Prone to hurry 
But also to be late 
It is impossible. 
The laws of the universe are unbreakable. 
A match is decided by everyone 
How to fully serve,
When to light up agree.
 
And you have your measure 
Extinguish or extinguish.
If only the goal was achieved — 
To stop evil in the bud.
