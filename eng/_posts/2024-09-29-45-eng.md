(Beggar): 
“They stole from me, stole from themselves —
Corruption is called.
Came to you,
And you get locked up.”

(Rich man:)
“I am the master, I did not bother,
Therefore, the storerooms are full.
You let someone else's saliva,
To lean out.

Where is the guarantee that I will give
And you won't tear it apart?
Let us believe your words,
Then you will get it.”
