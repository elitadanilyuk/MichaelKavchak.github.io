NEW TECHNOLOGIES
They are always scared.
Uncharted 
Alarms, scares. 
Before giving birth 
The pain is waiting
Give birth to a fertilised —
It hurts a lot.

Too high 
Threatened to fall 
Deep 
Into the abyss beckon.
The eye does not see —
Afraid of being betrayed.
Wide
He is in a hurry to travel.

To overcome the distance 
New to know
Fears of tearing
Hide to take.
