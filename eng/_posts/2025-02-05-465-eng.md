Advisors are needed by everyone,
Who makes important decisions â€”
To their improvement, to the enemies of deterioration
In peaceful conditions or in times of alarm.

The ruler and I, though I have no servants,
I control the body, I serve the soul.
To the left or to the right, I don't know right away.
They help
Thoughts are alien.

You are better, teach a fool:
And in disputes wiser than me
I listen to the truly wise,
Without driving away the worst from him.
