Be the owner of your sword
May it grow in your palm.
May it be native to Your shoulder,
To save from slavery and captivity.

Quotes of geniuses â€”
Grabbing other people's swords.
It is good to know and remember them.
May the search for God give birth to its own,
To live and die for them.

Someone else will paralyze and cut.
To get out of the fight as a winner,
Find your own, more reliable and fresh.
Hold on to the handle, be yourself.
