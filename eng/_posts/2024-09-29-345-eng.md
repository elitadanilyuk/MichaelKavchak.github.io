Historians will speculate,
Who started first.
The occupiers will lie,
They will be touched.
Silently they will remember
Who saw, who knew.

Beyond Nestor
They hide from the truth.
With the Winner-Aggressor 
They do not argue,
When the Conqueror
Relatives settle.

Primordial lands
Over time, they will name 
Center and outskirts.
The murdered brother will be handed over,
Saints will make Cain.
