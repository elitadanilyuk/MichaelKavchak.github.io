My universe is in my projection
It does not need to be copied
To recognize
He has dementia.

My constellations draw daisies
Trains and mountains. 
Your imagination is different
He speaks of the sky.

Don't worry, my friend
Don't dig in the worst â€”
You and I are not sick.
From your center in a different way 
Placed stars.
