QR codes — words, programs.
Protrances, dips, ones, zeros.
Agree with things, agree with opinions.
Appear, disappear from the face of the earth.

Make yourself happy with your lonely presence,
Do not become a hindrance on the highway —
Pour out a bunch of claims to the scoundrel,
Get on the horse, and he will bear it.

Crawl and bounce
Run away and come.
Let go and support
Just agree with the code.
