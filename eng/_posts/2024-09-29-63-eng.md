Wisdom Shah,
The infinity of options. 
As in life — 
Go and figure it out.
In their cages
Treasures of Talents.
Simple walks,
And learn and learn.

Only 6 figures,
6 vital statuses.
6 days Lord
Our world has created.
Borehole Ideas
And here it is effective:
Enter God
In the format of the game.

The Law of Life
Embedded in chess.
It is coded,
Understand for yourself. 
His fields —
Bliss and horrors,
Here or hinged,
Or rejoice.
