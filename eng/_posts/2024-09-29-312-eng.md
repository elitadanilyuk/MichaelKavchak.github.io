Born from the seeds of knowledge of good and evil 
Purgatory passes. 
They choose well, they accept life. 
Angry 
Die themselves 
And others are harmed.

To determine the status of nature and society â€” 
Your examiners.
A prison or a will, a village or a city,
Patrons and dictators.

And the inner voice, 
Conscience and conscience 
They look over the horizon. 
They offer confession.
The soul is saved.
