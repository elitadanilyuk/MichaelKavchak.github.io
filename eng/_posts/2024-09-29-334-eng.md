Overlaying the cards reveals an error,
A cunning plan becomes apparent.
The handwriting difference stands out
How much actions correspond to words.

And one condition 
Obligatory â€”
Transparency
Albeit partial,
Better yet, with the light from below.

And the answer is ready:
Regularity or randomness, 
Cunning or Conscience 
Did they spread the good or create a crisis?
