The aggressor seeks peace
In war, blame the victim.
He expects her to sincerely
She herself wanted to die.

From the knife of Kadyrovka,
From the Encavedist's Ball,
The spirit of Ukraine to fade 
From every village, village and city.

Do not spare poisons
In the local word, 
To hear on the “iskonna” 
Only the language of the invader.
