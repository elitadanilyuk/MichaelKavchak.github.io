There is nothing eternal — 
Appeared and disappeared. 
It was summer — and winter. 
You won't come back — it's a shame. 

Days, months and seasons
In the well of time, silt settles.
And after waiting for his time,
Repeatedly circle,

Because they are resurrected.
They have no end,
Even though they are dying...
Do you hear God's call?
