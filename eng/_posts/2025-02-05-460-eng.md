Through a tunnel without a navigator on the other side of the mountain â€” 
Unexpected views await there.
A lot of people talked about them 
But he didn't see it himself, they told him. 

And those who told, fantasized,
They only guessed, imagined.
I'll check it out myself 
And finally I recognize.
I would also tell you 
But I don't have the opportunity. 

Decided from the outside:
In order to achieve fullness by faith,
The path is one-way.
The reverse was ordered not to be laid.
