Without YannaShilop OgohNSharochv*
Ne vvijdec v zavtricnje,
Once upon a time when I stumbled,
__YYYYYYYYY_YYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY
You will find yourself under the grass.
Nocturnal 
There will be tomorrow,
For a long time
(Or maybe for a moment)
You will close from the sun.
 
The change is here,
In the lock.
However, she is not the last.
NATURE EXCITEMENT
Hints at the RESURRECTION.
 
Your personal, unfriendly
Stuck in the body,
R o z i y w l o s h p o v s u d n o,

*The poem is experimental, with elements of transliteration of Ukrainian text in Latin letters and symbolic allusions. And in an unusual combination of small and large letters, this rebus complements the past, future, stumbling, life and death, nature, waves (vibro-), resurrection, compression, expansion, ubiquity. With spices of asemic writing.
