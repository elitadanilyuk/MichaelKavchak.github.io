The Prince of Peace was born.
Dole sticks. 
The drone stopped
Returned home. 

Even for a day, who is faithful,
He won't kill, he won't rape.
Remembers that peaceful,
He jokes once a year.

Christ was born, 
To die gloriously...
... Then the soldier crossed
In the arms of death. 

@Так was in the first.
In the present world,
In the Age of Death
They do not stop the war. 

The more holiday, 
Especially rockets.
Hurry to send
The terrorist has his “pride”. 

A warrior is baptized, 
An orc is baptized.
For a more vicious fight 
Keep a smirk.
