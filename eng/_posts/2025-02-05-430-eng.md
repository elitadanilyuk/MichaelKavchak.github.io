Experiencing.
In the middle of the night I breathe hard —
He cares, watches over my sleep.
Alongside her anxiously quiet
Ready to overcome a million obstacles.

Let it reproach me that I ignore
What little I love, I forgot about her
“I need someone” — I will feel once again.
And I write,
Before falling asleep again.

There is strength in my breath,
Full of thoughts.
And even if you can't see them, be calm.
You have little me, you are lonely and tired,
But for thoughts, only you are the expediency and the essence.
