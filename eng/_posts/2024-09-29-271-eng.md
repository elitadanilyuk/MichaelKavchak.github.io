Manure coated
Produces well. 
The humiliated will become famous.
Who is hurting now,
It will break tomorrow.

Crafty outsmart yourself 
To a simple tide.
It will fly away from the trash, 
Uncut will find. 

How not to believe in karma? 
In the cycle of things? 
Beautifully conceived
About all ideas.
