When the door is locked,
Home-made 
Sleep peacefully.
Hut without inhabitants
Attracts the criminal.
Safety 
Generates wars
And pilgrim beggars.

Reliable 
Shield States,
Strong gate and latch
Quench 
Predator appetite,
What is special 
Flares at times.

Install armor, 
And under the armor armor. 
Resist the Fire
And protect your family.
