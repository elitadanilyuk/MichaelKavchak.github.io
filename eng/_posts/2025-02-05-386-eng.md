Shake to continue drawing.
There is a power that takes away, but there is —
What gives.
You have to run away from certain circumstances
Stranger to leave,
Capturing your own.

The bipolarity of the world in basements is clamped,
He will wear a crown, give and steal.
Stroke and hit, fall and freeze,
Accept — load,
Make it easier — take.

When you lose, you become empty 
Let them also wash away from uncleanness,
Polished to make it viable
It is more important to wear —
To record heights.
