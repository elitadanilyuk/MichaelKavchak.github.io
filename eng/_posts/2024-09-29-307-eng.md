Why break yourself?
Changing the poles to the other side will twist.
Instead of being jealous and lying
Attitude to change —
And let go.

In the loss to see the benefit,
Scoundrels are repentant tomorrow.
From the depressions lead to the exit,
Cheer up those who are in trouble.

Stop tolerating rudeness
And walk in the ways of falsehood —
Beggars will turn into lordship
In anger, you learn to love.
