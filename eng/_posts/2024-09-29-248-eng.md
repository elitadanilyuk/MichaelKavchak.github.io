To what 
This frequent dream?
I'm lost
In a strange city.
With the program knocked down 
Telephone,
Secluded and alarmed
I'm free, like in a cage.

The sun rises,
The nightmare is forgotten.
And the reality 
Leads
To the nodes,
What do not intertwine.

And from this dream
I want to wake up,
So in a dream I fall asleep
Tomorrow's answer
Transportable.
