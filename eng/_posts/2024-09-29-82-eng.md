Do not be afraid of different thinking
Allow yourself to argue.
From the beginning of the chronology
There is no end to life. 

We are eternally familiar with the taste.
Since there is no end,
Inflate, even though it will swell,
Not for yourself, for the glory of the Creator. 

The futile search of our souls
In the spiritual gyms of words,
And refusal to make concessions
To the offers of scammers.
