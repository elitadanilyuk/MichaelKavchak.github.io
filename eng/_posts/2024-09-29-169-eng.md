Bless
Instead of cursing.
You won't just see a miracle — 
You will enter it.
These will have to 
Receiving gifts —
Development of storerooms
There are not enough boundaries.
 
Trophy Thief
You will wear
Not things, but souls 
He will give you. 
Instead of dying — 
Will live,
Good will learn
Overcome the Misfortune.
 
Poor woman
The house will remain
For wealth 
It will fit into the heart.
And in the heavenly books 
Sign up: 
He was faithful to the end.
