Contrary to the clouds, the sun is above them,
Heat and light on top of obstacles
At the bottom, the character of a person is formed,
A truly submissive or violent people.

Some will understand that twilight is good,
The darkness will drive the others away.
But the best way to find balance is
Both the sun and the clouds are beneficial. 

Rain to water
In drought, press.
Don't be afraid of change.
Just to know
Where to stand
And where to hide.
