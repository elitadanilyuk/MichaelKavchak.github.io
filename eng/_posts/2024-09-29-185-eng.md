Feel the fullness
Without it is impossible.
He will offer,
Will refuse,
Agree,
Prohibit.
Set a goal,
Spills,
Blacken.
 
Equality of everyday life
Lifts
Or drop,
Dead lines
The oscillation will shift.
 
Beer and newspaper
Select.
Remove from the TV.
On the ground, not on the parquet
To reality
The wife will lead.
