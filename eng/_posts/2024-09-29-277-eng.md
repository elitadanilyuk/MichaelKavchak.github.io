Curiosity brings to light
In which, like a bubble, it cracks.
Admit why you are so manYish, educationally?
Who decides to meet with you?

Darkness from below pushes.
Isn't she the reason?
God Proclaims Himself
Yesterday man,
And now the car.

Ovo je evoluciju
Homo sapiens is not the top.
So the resolution is requested:
Red Clay served.
