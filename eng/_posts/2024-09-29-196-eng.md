Don't blame the sun
What comes down
Not on the other side
And not beets that bear fruit 
Not at that time of year. 
 
Right to choose
You didn't give yourself 
And you are not the order 
Installed,
But you chose, 
What kind of cheek I substituted,
In winter or summer 
Weeds weeded.
 
Return to the light 
The other side,
Treat the field in the summer 
Let him rest with winter.
Expose to the circumstances
Stay Brave
Worry to the God-slayer's Wife 
And fair bosses.
And it will be good for you.
