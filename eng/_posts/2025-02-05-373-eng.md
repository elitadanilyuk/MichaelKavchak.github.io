Lying for a long time, no one needs
Everyone bypasses an abandoned thing,
I hate myself in a foreign world.
Light surrounds, and inside it is night.

Only a ray of hope to wait until tomorrow,
From day to day it warms, the meaning adds.
“I will still be called,” the mantra maintains, 
They will appreciate my service.”

For each product there is a buyer, 
An unstressed tree is anthracite.
Let even a million deny you,
You are a deficit for someone.
