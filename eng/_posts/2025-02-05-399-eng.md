What is not Name — separate bag
For shame or glory.
Treasures and sand collected in it,
Harmful and useful things.

Aliases to divide, delimit
Garbage and necessary
Rearrange
Lush and convenient. 

Body, soul and spirit —
Different properties. 
Three in one without any separation
Distribute at the finish according to importance.
