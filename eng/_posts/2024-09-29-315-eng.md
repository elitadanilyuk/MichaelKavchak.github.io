As if there was one word,
And it clings in different ways.
Someone breaks, 
Someone treats and will come up,
Someone will leave
In the pophygial spring.

You don't always guess 
How will they perceive. 
You wish well — 
Evil will be heard.

I tell myself —
I collect for myself.
Someone listened —
According to the opinions of others 
No, I'm not answering.
Their ears.
