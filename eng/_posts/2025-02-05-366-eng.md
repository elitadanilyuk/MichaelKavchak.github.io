Lined squads look spectacular
Is that really their inner strength?
Comfortable in paradise, and hell ahead, 
Already the support of friends has weakened, faded.

Give up? Retreat?
Do we raise flags from bridges?
Otherwise we will not buy with the blood of liberty.
Definitely your own.
And we know it.

We don't need a stranger,
We have to defend ourselves.
With the support of the sky,
To not die, but to survive,
For yours and for you
We have to kill.
