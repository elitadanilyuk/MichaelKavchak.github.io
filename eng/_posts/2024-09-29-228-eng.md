There is no basis,
Although there are many masters.
And pay everyone
For simplicity.
And I find that myself
Also guilty,
Even though I'm nobody here
And the project is not mine.

Best to hide 
Behind other people's backs,
Lubricate your head
Confused boss.
The wise are silent,
They look innocent,
Even if it does not last a wave, 
The cable will break.

Planet in the hair 
Nothing is hung on,
And for some reason, to blame
And it is attributed to me.
