Moves us around the world
With plans or without.
Old, adults, children. 
I was in the village and suddenly there was a blast.

Someone says: but lucky. 
Pity others — it's hard there.
Life as the whirlwind took hold — 
Neither there nor am I.

There are no heroines at the exit,
Not in the parish either. 
It becomes freedom like a prison
But you don't cry in prison.
