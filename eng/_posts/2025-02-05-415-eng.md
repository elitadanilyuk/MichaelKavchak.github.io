Half a word, even a thought
Kindred hearts.
Intimate relationships grow
On the envy of enemies.

Not a day without kisses.
In the arms with the touch of the saw,
Even without extra gifts
A stranger becomes a native.

On the bedside
And at a distance in the spirit 
They want to merge with their stomachs and breasts
And finally in the ecstatic movement
Children continue to give birth.
