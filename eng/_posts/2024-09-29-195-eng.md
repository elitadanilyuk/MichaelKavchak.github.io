If people did not pay the debt,
And saving energy â€” 
The law is unshakable,
Why consider, 
That the money is gone, 
That you only sacrifice, 
Is someone insatiable?
 
Sincerely gives, 
And does not select.
The trouble heals,
And the costs are covered. 
 
Not returned? 
Invested. 
Forgot? 
They saw and heard in the sky, 
God
Compensated.
