You have, because someone has paid -
Father, Taras, Christ.
If it weren't for your mother, you wouldn't be alive.

Heat on the left, and frost on the right
The range between the extremes
The gap of comfort.

We stretch through the genera
To the Eternal Port
Corridor pierced
As stonemasons for us â€”
Among them is the Savior
And Kobzar Taras.
