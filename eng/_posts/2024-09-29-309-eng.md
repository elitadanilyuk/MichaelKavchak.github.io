I go through banal things
Everyone has long known
And why escape 
From the present in the house?

I'll rethink 
Reorganize â€” 
Premature shoes
Dill so that it does not sour.
I'm not chasing anything, 
I don't buy junk.

He did not carry an arrow,
Relaxed, pulled away.
Drunk in peace,
Votuzny got rid of it.
