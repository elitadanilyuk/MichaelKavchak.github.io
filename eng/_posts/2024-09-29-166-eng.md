Are you afraid?
Blessed, 
Where would you go without fear?
Saved courteous,
Obedient to the law of the eyes.
 
You can't go there 
And do not take it, 
And here you are worried,
And there wait for trouble.
 
In the center of the carousel 
The intimidated ascetic trembles.
And the paradox. 
Thoughts are fun â€”
He is a philosopher now.
Poet.
