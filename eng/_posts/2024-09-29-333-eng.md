Shocked, excited, clung to attention.
I share with others — a sensation. 
I tear off things, I attract to him.
But talent is such an ovation.

And suddenly the hack — the idol declares: 
Subscribe to him, likes and comments,
And the SVO he blesses,
He does not care about the arguments of the victims.

It is disgusting to look at a narcissus.
Love and adoration are shattered.
Now I'm sorry —
Let the scoundrels in it love.
