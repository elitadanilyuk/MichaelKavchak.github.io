In prayer, we ask — 
God's plans are broken.
Thank you — 
As we vote,
We do not force Him to do anything. 

May it be your will — 
In Otchenash we say.
It is not our self —
Instead of doing, let's lie down.

It is a sin to evade cooperation,
Knowing the intentions of the Lord, 
Necessary cooperation,
Achieving goals with Him,
