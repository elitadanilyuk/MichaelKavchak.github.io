Drink a friend. You are not a vampire.
It is pleasant for him to surrender to you.
And remember, only until then, 
While he wants to play with you,

So far he is interested in you.
So that the compulsion does not scold you,
In order not to sneak up on the cunning calculation,
Heated by someone. 

Society is God's gift,
Sunny meadow in a dark forest,
The gap between solid clouds â€” 
In a certain period and in a certain place.
