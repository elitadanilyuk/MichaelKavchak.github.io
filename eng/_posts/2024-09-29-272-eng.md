Velvet shadows of firs,
Mountains painted by nature, 
The gullible clatter of storks,
Beyond the spaces, the spaces are again.

Masterpieces on the showcases of beauties
So they ask for canvases.
Suddenly a stream rumbled from the side
And sang
The soul is carefree.

The charm of the Carpathians beckons
All sin takes away from you...
How to the edge love hurts so much
So how will the sky hurt?
