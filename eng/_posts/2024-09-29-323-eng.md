Possess the castles, break the guard —
Do not be surprised that the thief will steal property
Grabbed by the collar and driven out of the house,
They will bribe the judge, they will charge you.

If the household is ready for poverty, 
In foreign countries, beggar-whine —
Then the shedding of blood is inappropriate
A nation has not grown up, it must be nurtured.

If it does not suit
Mobilization.
Then everything refutes 
Surrender.
And when they want to save the country, 
They will find among themselves
Fighters to the bend.
