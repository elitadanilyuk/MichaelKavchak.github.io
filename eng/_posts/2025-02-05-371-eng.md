The lord gave me, but boasted not by the master —
Admire me, how cool I am.
And what, when tomorrow for the owner of the plan 
Will he hand over to another because I am not like that?

I'm not as cool as he hoped —
On a golden carriage, in a cylinder and a tailgate
Forgot about the nobleman, was proud of himself,
He imagined himself in glory, hired for work.

So my dear position,
Carriage and horses,
Because entrusted to the authorities,
I exalt her and submissive to her!
