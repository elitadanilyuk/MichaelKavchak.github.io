Birthday â€” 
New countdown:
Cold, heat, fruit.
Past experience feedback 
A wish in a few words.
 
Longing for the lost year
In the mirror, old age is approaching.
In a slightly slow step
A new feeling of joy...
 
In a new toy, in school, in love,
In education, car, career,
Children and grandchildren are waiting,
In the cemetery enclosure.
