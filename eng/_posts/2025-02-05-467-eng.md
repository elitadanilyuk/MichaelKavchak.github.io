Honey is sweet but sticky,
The bee bites, but it is surrounded by love.
The match is relatively light
That heavy ruin was destroyed by fire.

A word is just a sound, 
Air wave. No need for hands â€”
It will create so much.
Will lead to separation
Or the one who likes to say so,
Which will relieve mental anguish.
Scratching only the throat - out of nothing
Will revive the force
Comforting the sad
Weak invigorates.

Sweet, sticky, biting, healing,
Easy and hard is always with you.
Paralyzing or empowering
Surrenders or calls for battle.
