Someone is lucky — 
Draws the leader.
He hopes — 
They will pour gold.
And in the meantime, life 
Can hit with a hammer. 
 
Crawl to line up — 
The craft is thankless. 
Wait for the loss
Swallow—because it's delicious.
 
Write for yourself 
Worlds for yourself.
There will be a need — 
They will come after the fruit.
