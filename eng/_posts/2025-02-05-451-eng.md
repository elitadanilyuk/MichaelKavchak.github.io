A contrived creche of sparks, 
Overthought extinguishes fires.
Forgetting that he is tired, he forgets to sit down. 
Fanciful ideas smash boundaries.

The far-fetched offends 
The far-fetched is offended. 
Fauched sobs,
They smile at the far-fetched.

I have to choose 
What to think of. 
What to expel from yourself 
And what to caress.
