Who went to the forest for flowers,
It does not collect a lot of mushrooms. 
If you seek, but you don't want to find, 
You will come to the conclusion that they do not exist. 

You were not kissed 
And you will not lose it yourself,
They drove out from everywhere, 
I thought to myself â€” 
And you love. 

Desperate say there is no love,
Reincarnation is not possible.
A pine tree will not give you apples in the forest 
And acacia pine cones.
